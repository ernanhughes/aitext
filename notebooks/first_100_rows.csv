Study of coupling loss on bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes by a.c. susceptibility measurements,0,"Coupling losses were studied in composite tapes containing superconducting material in the form of two separate stacks of densely packed filaments embedded in a metallic matrix of Ag or Ag alloy. This kind of sample geometry is quite favorable for studying the coupling currents and in particular the role of superconducting bridges between filaments. By using a.c. susceptibility technique, the electromagnetic losses as function of a.c. magnetic field amplitude and frequency were measured at the temperature T = 77 K for two tapes with different matrix composition. The length of samples was varied by subsequent cutting in order to investigate its influence on the dynamics of magnetic flux penetration. The geometrical factor $\chi_0$ which takes into account the demagnetizing effects was established from a.c. susceptibility data at low amplitudes. Losses vs frequency dependencies have been found to agree nicely with the theoretical model developed for round multifilamentary wires.

Applying this model, the effective resistivity of the matrix was determined for each tape, by using only measured quantities. For the tape with pure silver matrix its value was found to be larger than what predicted by the theory for given metal resistivity and filamentary architecture. On the contrary, in the sample with a Ag/Mg alloy matrix, an effective resistivity much lower than expected was determined. We explain these discrepancies by taking into account the properties of the electrical contact of the interface between the superconducting filaments and the normal matrix. In the case of soft matrix of pure Ag, this is of poor quality, while the properties of alloy matrix seem to provoke an extensive creation of intergrowths which can be actually observed in this kind of samples.",280
Study of coupling loss on bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes by a.c. susceptibility measurements,1,"In this study, we investigate the coupling loss on bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes using a.c. susceptibility measurements. The bi-columnar structure of BSCCO tapes is known to offer several advantages over traditional tape configurations, including increased tolerance to magnetic field disturbances. However, the effects of the Bi-2212/Ag interface on the coupling between the superconducting filaments of the BSCCO tape is not well understood. Our experiments show that the coupling loss is dominated by the Bi-2212/Ag interface and varies significantly with the orientation and magnitude of the applied a.c. magnetic field. Specifically, coupling loss is found to be lower for in-plane magnetic fields and higher for out-of-plane magnetic fields. We also observe that the annealing of the tapes significantly affects the coupling loss, as annealed tapes exhibit lower loss values than unannealed tapes. Furthermore, we find that the coupling loss is sensitive to the orientation of the Ag matrix, as demonstrated by measurements on tapes with both transverse and longitudinal matrix orientation. Finally, we use numerical simulations to confirm the validity of our experimental results. Overall, this study provides important insights into the coupling loss mechanisms in bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes, which are highly relevant for the development of practical applications of high-temperature superconductors.",215
Weighted Solyanik estimates for the strong maximal function,0,"Let $\mathsf M_{\mathsf S}$ denote the strong maximal operator on $\mathbb R^n$ and let $w$ be a non-negative, locally integrable function. For $\alpha\in(0,1)$ we define the weighted sharp Tauberian constant $\mathsf C_{\mathsf S}$ associated with $\mathsf M_{\mathsf S}$ by $$ \mathsf C_{\mathsf S} (\alpha):= \sup_{\substack {E\subset \mathbb R^n \\ 0<w(E)<+\infty}}\frac{1}{w(E)}w(\{x\in\mathbb R^n:\, \mathsf M_{\mathsf S}(\mathbf{1}_E)(x)>\alpha\}). $$ We show that $\lim_{\alpha\to 1^-} \mathsf C_{\mathsf S} (\alpha)=1$ if and only if $w\in A_\infty ^*$, that is if and only if $w$ is a strong Muckenhoupt weight. This is quantified by the estimate $\mathsf C_{\mathsf S}(\alpha)-1\lesssim_{n} (1-\alpha)^{(cn [w]_{A_\infty ^*})^{-1}}$ as $\alpha\to 1^-$, where $c>0$ is a numerical constant; this estimate is sharp in the sense that the exponent $1/(cn[w]_{A_\infty ^*})$ can not be improved in terms of $[w]_{A_\infty ^*}$. As corollaries, we obtain a sharp reverse H\""older inequality for strong Muckenhoupt weights in $\mathbb R^n$ as well as a quantitative imbedding of $A_\infty^*$ into $A_{p}^*$. We also consider the strong maximal operator on $\mathbb R^n$ associated with the weight $w$ and denoted by $\mathsf M_{\mathsf S} ^w$. In this case the corresponding sharp Tauberian constant $\mathsf C_{\mathsf S} ^w$ is defined by $$ \mathsf C_{\mathsf S} ^w \alpha) := \sup_{\substack {E\subset \mathbb R^n \\ 0<w(E)<+\infty}}\frac{1}{w(E)}w(\{x\in\mathbb R^n:\, \mathsf M_{\mathsf S} ^w (\mathbf{1}_E)(x)>\alpha\}).$$ We show that there exists some constant $c_{w,n}>0$ depending only on $w$ and the dimension $n$ such that $\mathsf C_{\mathsf S} ^w (\alpha)-1 \lesssim_{w,n} (1-\alpha)^{c_{w,n}}$ as $\alpha\to 1^-$ whenever $w\in A_\infty ^*$ is a strong Muckenhoupt weight.",332
Weighted Solyanik estimates for the strong maximal function,1,"In this paper, we investigate Weighted Solyanik Estimates for the Strong Maximal Function. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal range of weights for which the Solyanik estimates hold true for the strong maximal function in both dyadic and non-dyadic contexts. Our work is motivated by recent developments in the area of harmonic analysis and Fourier analysis, which have demonstrated the importance of the strong maximal function in many areas of mathematics. We begin our investigation by defining the strong maximal function and introducing the weighted Solyanik estimates. We then analyze the properties of the strong maximal function and its relationship to weighted estimates. Our findings demonstrate that the range of suitable weights for the Solyanik estimates is significantly larger in the dyadic context than in the non-dyadic context. Moreover, we establish new estimates for the strong maximal function in the dyadic context, which improve upon existing results. Our study contributes to the development of more precise and accurate techniques for analyzing the strong maximal function, and may have potential applications in other areas of mathematics as well. In conclusion, our investigation of Weighted Solyanik Estimates for the Strong Maximal Function provides new insights into this important topic in harmonic analysis, and we expect our results to be of interest to researchers in this field and related areas of study.",225
SOFIA-EXES Observations of Betelgeuse during the Great Dimming of 2019/2020,0,"In 2019 October Betelgeuse began a decline in V-band brightness that went beyond the minimum expected from its quasi-periodic ~420 day cycle, becoming the faintest in recorded photometric history. Observations obtained in 2019 December with VLT/SPHERE (Montarges 2020) have shown that the southern half of the star has become markedly fainter than in 2019 January indicating that a major change has occurred in, or near, the photosphere.

We present SOFIA-EXES high spectral-resolution observations of [Fe II] 25.99 mic and [S I] 25.25 mic emission lines from Betelgeuse obtained during the unprecedented 2020 February V-band brightness minimum to investigate potential changes in the circumstellar flow. These spectra are compared to observations obtained in 2015 and 2017 when the V magnitude was typical of brighter phases.

We find only very small changes in the gas velocities reflected by either of the line profiles, no significant changes in the flux to continuum ratios, and hence no significant changes in the [Fe II]/[S I] flux ratios. There is evidence that absorption features have appeared in the 2020 continuum.

The Alfven wave-crossing time from the upper-photosphere is sufficiently long that one would not expect a change in the large scale magnetic field to reach the circumstellar [Fe II] and [S I] line forming regions, 3 < R(R*) < 20.

However, the light-crossing time is of order a few hours and a reduction in luminosity may reduce the dust-gas heating rate and [O I] 63.19 mic emission which has contributions from R > 20R*, where significant circumstellar oxygen-rich dust is observed.",268
SOFIA-EXES Observations of Betelgeuse during the Great Dimming of 2019/2020,1,"SOFIA-EXES Observations of Betelgeuse During the Great Dimming of 2019/2020

Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in the constellation Orion, exhibited a significant dimming event starting in late 2019 to early 2020. This phenomenon captured the attention of both amateur and professional astronomers alike, leading to numerous studies utilizing various observation techniques.

In this paper, we present the findings from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) - Echelon-Cross-Echelle Spectrograph (EXES) observations of Betelgeuse during the great dimming event. We utilized a high-resolution mid-infrared spectrometer that allowed us to study the star’s atmosphere in detail and monitor its evolution over time.

Our analysis indicates that the dimming event was caused by the formation of a large cloud of dust in Betelgeuse’s atmosphere, with the specific trigger mechanism still under investigation. The cloud reached its maximum size and opacity in February 2020 before dissipating in April of the same year. We also observed variations in temperature and apparent size of the star, which may be related to the dimming event.

These SOFIA-EXES observations provide valuable insight into the mechanisms driving Betelgeuse’s complex atmosphere and offer a detailed look into its behavior during the great dimming event. Our findings contribute to the ongoing effort to understand the life cycle of massive stars and their role in the evolution of our universe.",227
Forward Modelling of Standing Kink Modes in Coronal Loops I. Synthetic Views,0,"Kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are frequently observed in various magnetic structures of the solar atmosphere. They may contribute significantly to coronal heating and could be used as a tool to diagnose the solar plasma. In this study, we synthesise the \ion{Fe}{9} $\lambda171.073$ emission of a coronal loop supporting a standing kink MHD mode. The kink MHD wave solution of a plasma cylinder is mapped into a semi-torus structure to simulate a curved coronal loop. We decompose the solution into a quasi-rigid kink motion and a quadrupole term, which dominate the plasma inside and outside the flux tube, respectively. At the loop edges, the line-of-sight integrates relatively more ambient plasma, and the background emission becomes significant. The plasma motion associated with the quadrupole term causes spectral line broadening and emission suppression. The periodic intensity suppression will modulate the integrated intensity and the effective loop width, which both exhibit oscillatory variations at half of the kink period. The quadrupole term can be directly observed as a pendular motion at front view.",176
Forward Modelling of Standing Kink Modes in Coronal Loops I. Synthetic Views,1,"This paper presents an investigation of standing kink modes in coronal loops using forward modelling techniques. The study is focused on generating synthetic views of these modes by using numerical simulations that take into account the plasma's physical properties, including density, temperature, and magnetic field strength. A detailed analysis of the generated synthetic views is performed, revealing the spatial and temporal behavior of the standing kink modes in coronal loops. The results show the importance of considering the plasma's properties when modeling these modes, as well as the potential of using synthetic views to interpret observational data. Additionally, the study explores the influence of the energy distribution on the stability and evolution of these modes, shedding light on the physical mechanisms underlying their dynamics. Overall, the paper reveals new insights into the behavior of standing kink modes in coronal loops through the use of forward modelling techniques.",149
Prevailing dust-transport directions on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,0,"Dust transport and deposition behind larger boulders on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) have been observed by the Rosetta mission.

We present a mechanism for dust transport vectors based on a homogenous surface activity model incorporating in detail the topography of 67P/C-G. The combination of gravitation, gas drag, and Coriolis force leads to specific dust transfer pathways, which for higher dust velocities fuel the near nucleus coma.

By distributing dust sources homogeneously across the whole cometary surface, we derive a global dust-transport map of 67P/C-G. The transport vectors are in agreement with the reported wind-tail directions in the Philae descent area.",110
Prevailing dust-transport directions on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,1,"This study investigates the prevailing dust-transport directions on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. We analyzed images taken by the Rosetta spacecraft's OSIRIS camera during the comet's closest approach to the sun. We find that most of the dust transported from the comet's surface follows two general directions, which are correlated with the local topography. The first direction is related to the steep, bright cliffs in the Imhotep region. The second direction is associated with the flatter terrains in the Anhur and Atum regions. Our findings enhance our understanding of the dust dynamics on comets and provide insights into the evolution of comet surfaces.",106
Full-Wave Feasibility Study of Anti-Radar Diagnostic of Magnetic Field Based on O-X Mode Conversion and Oblique Reflectometry Imaging,0,"An innovative millimeter wave diagnostic is proposed to measure the local magnetic field and edge current as a function of the minor radius in the tokamak pedestal region. The idea is to identify the direction of minimum reflectivity at the O-mode cutoff layer. Correspondingly, the transmissivity due to O-X mode conversion is maximum. That direction, and the angular map of reflectivity around it, contain information on the magnetic field vector B at the cutoff layer. Probing the plasma with different wave frequencies provides the radial profile of B. Full-wave finite-element simulations are presented here in 2D slab geometry. Modeling confirms the existence of a minimum in reflectivity that depends on the magnetic field at the cutoff, as expected from mode conversion physics, giving confidence in the feasibility of the diagnostic. The proposed reflectometric approach is expected to yield superior signal-to-noise ratio and to access wider ranges of density and magnetic field, compared with related radiometric techniques that require the plasma to emit Electron Bernstein Waves. Due to computational limitations, frequencies of 10-20 GHz were considered in this initial study. Frequencies above the edge electron-cyclotron frequency (f>28 GHz here) would be preferable for the experiment, because the upper hybrid resonance and right cutoff would lie in the plasma, and would help separate the O-mode of interest from spurious X-waves.",229
Full-Wave Feasibility Study of Anti-Radar Diagnostic of Magnetic Field Based on O-X Mode Conversion and Oblique Reflectometry Imaging,1,"This paper presents a feasibility study of an anti-radar diagnostic of magnetic fields through a combination of O-X mode conversion and oblique reflectometry imaging. The proposed method relies on the conversion of the ordinary (O) mode of a probing electromagnetic wave into an extraordinary (X) mode, which interacts with the magnetic field and generates a secondary wave. This secondary wave is then detected and analyzed through oblique reflectometry imaging, which provides additional information about the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the field. A full-wave approach, based on a numerical simulation of the electromagnetic waves and their interaction with the plasma, is used to investigate the feasibility and performance of the method. The simulation results show that the proposed technique is capable of detecting magnetic fields in various plasma environments, including fusion plasmas, with high accuracy and spatial resolution. The study also includes an analysis of the sensitivity of the method to different plasma parameters and experimental conditions, as well as a comparison with other diagnostic techniques. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method as a valuable tool for magnetic field diagnostics in diverse plasma physics research applications.",193
Time-Dependent Models for Blazar Emissions with the Second-Order Fermi Acceleration,0,"The second-order Fermi acceleration (Fermi-II) driven by turbulence may be responsible for the electron acceleration in blazar jets. We test this model with time-dependent simulations. The hard electron spectrum predicted by the Fermi-II process agrees with the hard photon spectrum of 1ES 1101-232. For other blazars that show softer spectra, the Fermi-II model requires radial evolution of the electron injection rate and/or diffusion coefficient in the outflow. Such evolutions can yield a curved electron spectrum, which can reproduce the synchrotron spectrum of Mrk 421 from the radio to the X-ray regime.The photon spectrum in the GeV energy range of Mrk 421 is hard to fit with a synchrotron self-Compton model. However, if we introduce an external radio photon field with a luminosity of $4.9 \times 10^{38}~\mbox{erg}~\mbox{s}^{-1}$, GeV photons are successfully produced via inverse Compton scattering. The temporal variability of the diffusion coefficient or injection rate causes flare emission. The observed synchronicity of X-ray and TeV flares implies a decrease of the magnetic field in the flaring source region.",186
Time-Dependent Models for Blazar Emissions with the Second-Order Fermi Acceleration,1,"Blazars display a distinct, often extreme variability in their luminosities, indicating that the particles responsible for their emissions are being accelerated. A possible mechanism for such acceleration is the second-order Fermi acceleration. Here we present time-dependent models for blazar emissions based on this mechanism. We employ a kinetic approach, taking into account the injection, acceleration, and eventual cooling of particles in the plasma, and use numerical simulations to predict the resulting radiation output. Our findings suggest that the second-order Fermi acceleration plays an important role in shaping the variability of blazar emissions. In particular, our models can reproduce the observed spectral energy distributions and light curves well. We also investigate the dependence of the emission properties on various parameters, such as the particle injection rate, magnetic field strength, and the efficiency of turbulent mixing. These models have implications for our understanding of particle acceleration in extreme astrophysical environments and can guide future observations of blazar emissions.",159
"Lithium in the Intermediate-Age Open Cluster, NGC 3680",0,"High-dispersion spectra centered on the Li 6708 A line have been obtained for 70 potential members of the open cluster NGC 3680, with an emphasis on stars in the turnoff region. A measurable Li abundance has been derived for 53 stars, 39 of which have radial velocities and proper motions consistent with cluster membership. After being transferred to common temperature and abundance scales, previous Li estimates have been combined to generate a sample of 49 members, 40 of which bracket the cluster Li-dip. Spectroscopic elemental analysis of 8 giants and 5 turnoff stars produces [Fe/H] = -0.17 +/- 0.07 (sd) and -0.07 +/- 0.02 (sd), respectively. We also report measurements of Ca, Si and Ni which are consistent with scaled-solar ratios within the errors. Adopting [Fe/H] = -0.08 (Sect. 3.6), Y^2 isochrone comparisons lead to an age of 1.75 +/- 0.10 Gyr and an apparent modulus of (m-M) = 10.30 +/- 0.15 for the cluster, placing the center of the Li-dip at 1.35 +/- 0.03 solar masses. Among the giants, 5 of 9 cluster members are now known to have measurable Li with A(Li) near 1.0. A combined sample of dwarfs in the Hyades and Praesepe is used to delineate the Li-dip profile at 0.7 Gyr and [Fe/H] = +0.15, establishing its center at 1.42 +/- 0.02 solar masses and noting the possible existence of secondary dip on its red boundary. When evolved to the typical age of the clusters NGC 752, IC 4651 and NGC 3680, the Hyades/Praesepe Li-dip profile reproduces the observed morphology of the combined Li-dip within the CMD's of the intermediate-age clusters while implying a metallicity dependence for the central mass of the Li-dip given by Mass = (1.38 +/-0.04) + (0.4 +/- 0.2)[Fe/H]. The implications of the similarity of the Li-dichotomy among giants in NGC 752 and IC 4651 and the disagreement with the pattern among NGC 3680 giants are discussed.",344
"Lithium in the Intermediate-Age Open Cluster, NGC 3680",1,"The open cluster, NGC 3680, has been of interest to many astronomers due to its intermediate age and proximity to the Sun. Recently, lithium has also emerged as a topic of great interest within the cluster. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the lithium abundance of NGC 3680 stars using high-resolution spectra obtained with the Fibre-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS) at the La Silla Observatory.

Our sample comprises 80 stars within the cluster, with effective temperatures ranging from 4900 K to 6800 K and atmospheric pressures of 1.5 to 4.0 dex. We find no significant correlation between the effective temperature and the lithium abundance of the stars. However, we do observe a negative correlation between the lithium abundance and the stellar age, which indicates that the depletion of lithium is due to post-main sequence depletion. Furthermore, we find that the number of lithium-rich stars is lower than expected, which may be attributed to the disk destruction and mixing caused by the Galactic tide.

We also compare our NGC 3680 results to other open clusters with similar metallicities. Our findings suggest that the lithium-rich stars in NGC 3680 are relatively younger than those in other open clusters. This result has important implications for the development of lithium depletion models, especially since the depletion process is extremely dependent on the age of the open cluster. Additionally, this study uncovers a new perspective on the lithium abundance of intermediate-age open clusters and sheds light on the cosmic evolutionary history of the Milky Way.

In conclusion, our study provides an in-depth analysis of the lithium abundance of the intermediate-age open cluster, NGC 3680. Our findings offer new insights into the formation and evolution of open clusters, as well as the depletion of lithium during post-main sequence stars. Further research in this field is crucial for understanding the origin of the elements in our universe and the chemical evolution of galaxies.",329
GSP-spec line list for the parametrisation of Gaia -RVS stellar spectra,0,"The Gaia mission is a magnitude-limited whole-sky survey that collects an impressive quantity of astrometric, spectro-photometric and spectroscopic data.

Among all the on-board instruments, the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) produces millions of spectra up to a magnitude of G$_{RVS} \sim 16$. For the brightest RVS targets, stellar atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances are automatically estimated by the Generalized Stellar Parametriser - spectroscopy group (GSP-Spec). These data will be published with the third Gaia Data Release. Some major ingredients of the determination of these stellar parameters include the atomic and molecular line lists that are adopted to compute reference synthetic spectra, on which the parametrisation methods rely.

We aim to build such a specific line list optimised for the analysis of RVS late-type star spectra. Starting from the Gaia-ESO line lists, we first compared the observed and synthetic spectra of six well-known reference late-type stars in the wavelength range covered by the RVS instrument. We then improved the quality of the atomic data for the transitions presenting the largest mismatches. The new line list is found to produce very high-quality synthetic spectra for the tested reference stars and has thus been adopted within GSP-Spec.",206
GSP-spec line list for the parametrisation of Gaia -RVS stellar spectra,1,"In this study, a GSP-spec line list has been created to facilitate the parametrization of stellar spectra obtained by Gaia-RVS. This line list is based on the latest atomic and molecular data, and includes approximately 61,000 spectral lines covering the wavelength range of Gaia-RVS (845-872 nm). The line list has been optimised to improve the accuracy and precision of elemental abundances derived from Gaia-RVS spectra, and includes corrections for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The parametrization method has also been refined, using a combination of spectral synthesis and statistical techniques, to improve the precision of stellar atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. The accuracy of the GSP-spec line list and the parametrization method has been tested using synthetic spectra, and the results indicate that this approach yields precise and accurate determination of stellar atmospheric parameters for stars with signal-to-noise ratios above 30. This line list and parametrization method have significant applications in large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, which aims to measure the kinematic and chemical properties of more than one billion stars in the Milky Way.",192
Online Recovery Guarantees and Analytical Results for OMP,0,"Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is a simple, yet empirically competitive algorithm for sparse recovery. Recent developments have shown that OMP guarantees exact recovery of K-sparse signals with K or more than K iterations if the observation matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with some conditions. We develop RIP-based online guarantees for recovery of a K-sparse signal with more than K OMP iterations. Though these guarantees cannot be generalized to all sparse signals a priori, we show that they can still hold online when the state-of-the-art K-step recovery guarantees fail. In addition, we present bounds on the number of correct and false indices in the support estimate for the derived condition to be less restrictive than the K-step guarantees. Under these bounds, this condition guarantees exact recovery of a K-sparse signal within 3K/2 iterations, which is much less than the number of steps required for the state-of-the-art exact recovery guarantees with more than K steps. Moreover, we present phase transitions of OMP in comparison to basis pursuit and subspace pursuit, which are obtained after extensive recovery simulations involving different sparse signal types. Finally, we empirically analyse the number of false indices in the support estimate, which indicates that these do not violate the developed upper bound in practice.",221
Online Recovery Guarantees and Analytical Results for OMP,1,"This paper presents a comprehensive study of online recovery guarantees and analytical results for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). We begin by examining the asymptotic analysis of OMP- a well-known greedy algorithm used in sparse signal recovery. Specifically, we investigate the precise conditions under which OMP successfully recovers a sparse signal and derive the corresponding lower bounds on the sparsity level. In addition, we establish concentration inequalities that control the deviation of OMP's estimate from the true signal. Building on these theoretical results, we present the online recovery guarantees for OMP in a non-adaptive setting where the signal is drawn from a fixed distribution. We study the performance of OMP under different levels of sparsity and noise and demonstrate that online OMP attains a desirable trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, we validate our analytical results through numerical experiments and showcase the effectiveness of OMP in practical sparse recovery applications. Overall, our theoretical and experimental analysis demonstrates the robustness and versatility of OMP, making it a potential tool for a wide range of signal processing tasks.",180
4d Gauge Theory and Gravity Generated from 3d Ones at High Energy,0,"Dynamical generation of 4d gauge theories and gravity at low energy from the 3d ones at high energy is studied, based on the fermion condensation mechanism recently proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen and Georgi. For gravity, 4d Einstein gravity is generated from the multiple copy of the 3d ones, by referring to the two form gravity. Since the 3d Einstein action without matter coupling is topological, ultraviolet divergences are less singular in our model. In the gauge model, matter fermions are introduced on the discrete lattice following Wilson. Then, the 4d gauge interactions are correctly generated from the 3d theories even in the left-right asymmetric theories of the standard model. In order for this to occur, the Higgs fields as well as the gauge fields of the extra dimension should be generated by the fermion condensates. Therefore, the generation of the 4d standard model from the multiple copy of the 3d ones is quite promising. To solve the doubling problem in the weak interaction sector, two kinds of discrete lattices have to be introduced separately for L- and R-handed sectors, and the two types of Higgs fields should be generated.",192
4d Gauge Theory and Gravity Generated from 3d Ones at High Energy,1,"In this paper, we investigate the relationship between 4d gauge theory and gravity that arises from 3d ones at high energy. We explore the dualities between these theories and their implications for our understanding of fundamental physics. Using tools from holography and quantum field theory, we provide evidence for these dualities and show that they are crucial for describing the behavior of strongly coupled systems. Our results suggest a new perspective on the nature of gravity and its connection to gauge theory, potentially opening new avenues for research in theoretical physics. We also discuss the role played by the holographic principle in this context and its connection to the emergence of spacetime geometry. Our work sheds light on the deep connections between seemingly disparate theories and provides a framework for studying the behavior of high-energy systems. Overall, this paper represents a significant contribution to the ongoing efforts to unify the fundamental forces of nature.",155
Cooperative Binning for Semi-deterministic Channels with Non-causal State Information,0,"The capacity of the semi-deterministic relay channel (SD-RC) with non-causal channel state information (CSI) only at the encoder and decoder is characterized. The capacity is achieved by a scheme based on cooperative-bin-forward. This scheme allows cooperation between the transmitter and the relay without the need to decode a part of the message by the relay.

The transmission is divided into blocks and each deterministic output of the channel (observed by the relay) is mapped to a bin. The bin index is used by the encoder and the relay to choose the cooperation codeword in the next transmission block. In causal settings the cooperation is independent of the state. In \emph{non-causal} settings dependency between the relay's transmission and the state can increase the transmission rates. The encoder implicitly conveys partial state information to the relay. In particular, it uses the states of the next block and selects a cooperation codeword accordingly and the relay transmission depends on the cooperation codeword and therefore also on the states. We also consider the multiple access channel with partial cribbing as a semi-deterministic channel. The capacity region of this channel with non-causal CSI is achieved by the new scheme. Examining the result in several cases, we introduce a new problem of a point-to-point (PTP) channel where the state is provided to the transmitter by a state encoder.

Interestingly, even though the CSI is also available at the receiver, we provide an example which shows that the capacity with non-causal CSI at the state encoder is strictly larger than the capacity with causal CSI.",271
Cooperative Binning for Semi-deterministic Channels with Non-causal State Information,1,"The problem of channel coding in cooperative communication systems is well studied in the literature, but most of the existing work assumes that the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter in a causal fashion. However, in many practical situations, the CSI is only available non-causally, which is a more challenging scenario for cooperative communication. In this paper, we address the issue of cooperative binning for semi-deterministic channels with non-causal state information (NCSI). 

Our approach is based on the idea of ""CSI binning,"" which is a technique for organizing the CSI at the receivers by dividing it into multiple bins. Each bin contains a subset of CSI values that are associated with a particular decoding outcome. We propose a new scheme for cooperative binning that is specifically designed to exploit the NCSI at the receivers. Our scheme is based on a two-phase protocol that involves a preliminary calibration phase, followed by a data transmission phase. During the calibration phase, the receivers cooperate to estimate the NCSI, and use it to construct the CSI bins. In the transmission phase, the transmitter sends information to the receivers by using a combination of binning and superposition coding. 

We analyze the performance of our scheme in terms of the achievable rates and the error probabilities. We show that, under certain conditions, our scheme achieves rates that approach the capacity of the semi-deterministic channel with NCSI. Our results suggest that cooperative binning is an effective approach for dealing with the challenging scenario of NCSI, and provides new insights into the design of cooperative communication systems.",267
Efficiently Approximating Edit Distance Between Pseudorandom Strings,0,"We present an algorithm for approximating the edit distance $\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ between two strings $x$ and $y$ in time parameterized by the degree to which one of the strings $x$ satisfies a natural pseudorandomness property. The pseudorandomness model is asymmetric in that no requirements are placed on the second string $y$, which may be constructed by an adversary with full knowledge of $x$.

We say that $x$ is \emph{$(p, B)$-pseudorandom} if all pairs $a$ and $b$ of disjoint $B$-letter substrings of $x$ satisfy $\operatorname{ed}(a, b) \ge pB$.

Given parameters $p$ and $B$, our algorithm computes the edit distance between a $(p, B)$-pseudorandom string $x$ and an arbitrary string $y$ within a factor of $O(1/p)$ in time $\tilde{O}(nB)$, with high probability.

Our algorithm is robust in the sense that it can handle a small portion of $x$ being adversarial (i.e., not satisfying the pseudorandomness property). In this case, the algorithm incurs an additive approximation error proportional to the fraction of $x$ which behaves maliciously.

The asymmetry of our pseudorandomness model has particular appeal for the case where $x$ is a \emph{source string}, meaning that $\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ will be computed for many strings $y$. Suppose that one wishes to achieve an $O(\alpha)$-approximation for each $\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ computation, and that $B$ is the smallest block-size for which the string $x$ is $(1/\alpha, B)$-pseudorandom. We show that without knowing $B$ beforehand, $x$ may be preprocessed in time $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}\sqrt{B})$, so that all future computations of the form $\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ may be $O(\alpha)$-approximated in time $\tilde{O}(nB)$. Furthermore, for the special case where only a single $\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ computation will be performed, we show how to achieve an $O(\alpha)$-approximation in time $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3}B^{2/3})$.",321
Efficiently Approximating Edit Distance Between Pseudorandom Strings,1,"Given the ubiquity of text data and the need to match or compare strings, the problem of efficiently approximating the edit distance between pseudorandom strings is of considerable importance. The edit distance between two strings is the minimum number of edit operations (insertions, deletions, and replacements) required to transform one string into another.

In many applications, strings are generated randomly and have a large alphabet, making exact computation of the edit distance computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach for approximating the edit distance between two pseudorandom strings with high probability. Our algorithm is based on sketching the strings into small, easily computable summaries, and then applying a pairwise hashing scheme to estimate the edit distance.

Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm achieves a constant approximation factor with high probability, and the runtime of our algorithm is linear in the length of the strings. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms for approximating edit distance on a variety of random and real-world data sets.

Furthermore, we show that our algorithm scales well for multi-string similarity search, where the goal is to find all pairs of strings in a collection with edit distance below a given threshold. Our approach leverages the properties of pseudorandomness to design compact sketches that are preserved under edit operations, allowing us to perform efficient pairwise comparisons and filtering.

In conclusion, our proposed algorithm provides an efficient and effective method for approximating the edit distance between pseudorandom strings. We believe that our work contributes towards the development of fast and accurate string matching techniques, which are essential for many applications in information retrieval, natural language processing, and computational biology.",284
Influential Node Ranking in Complex Networks Using A Randomized DynamicsSensitive Approach,0,"Identifying the most influential nodes in information networks has been the focus of many research studies. This problem has crucial applications in various contexts including biology, medicine, and social science, such as controlling the propagation of viruses or rumours in real world networks. While existing methods mostly employ local neighbourhood features which heavily rely on the network structure and disregard the underlying diffusion dynamics, in this work we present a randomized sampling algorithm that not only takes into account the local and global structural features of the network but also considers the underlying diffusion dynamics and its parameters. The main idea is to compute the influentiality of a node through reachability from that node in a set of random graphs. We use a hyper-graph to capture the reachability from nodes in the original network, and theoretically argue that the hypergraph can be used to approximate the theoretical influentiality of nodes in the original graph with a factor of 1 - epsilon. The performance of the proposed model is also evaluated empirically by measuring the correlation between the ranking generated by the proposed method and the ground truth ranking. Our results show that the proposed method substantially outperforms state of the art methods and achieves the highest correlation with the ground-truth ranking, while the generated ranking has a high level of uniqueness and uniformity.

Theoretical and practical analysis of the running time of the algorithm also confirms that the proposed method maintains a competitive running time in comparison to the state of the art methods.",255
Influential Node Ranking in Complex Networks Using A Randomized DynamicsSensitive Approach,1,"The analysis of complex networks is a crucial factor in the understanding and exploration of various systems, from social networks to biological and technological systems. In this study, we present a new approach to measure the influential node ranking in such networks using a dynamic-sensitive method. Our proposed method employs a randomized algorithm that not only takes into account the graph topology but also considers the history of the network's evolution to measure node influence. We show that our method is consistent and able to overcome the limitations of the existing methods that are only concerned with the static properties of the network. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of moderate-to-large scale networks, including social networks and biological networks. The proposed approach provides a more accurate representation of the importance of a node in a complex network and can aid in the analysis of these networks. The results also emphasize the importance of the temporal dimension in measuring node importance, particularly in dynamic systems where the structure and behavior of the network are affected by the past and current state. Overall, our study showcases the importance of adopting a dynamic-sensitive approach to investigate influential node ranking in complex networks.",209
"From magnetic order to quantum disorder: a $\mu$SR study of the Zn-barlowite series of $S={\frac{1}{2}}$ kagom\'e antiferromagnets, Zn$_{x}$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_{6}$FBr",0,"We report a comprehensive muon spectroscopy study of the Zn-barlowite series of $S={\frac{1}{2}}$ kagom\'e antiferromagnets, Zn$_x$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_{6}$FBr, for $x=0.00$ to $0.99(1)$. By combining muon spin relaxation and rotation measurements with state-of-the-art density-functional theory muon-site calculations, we observe the formation of both $\mu$--F and $\mu$--OH complexes in Zn-barlowite. From these stopping sites, implanted muon spins reveal the suppression of long-range magnetic order into a possible quantum spin liquid state upon increasing concentration of Zn-substitution. In the parent compound ($x=0$), static long-range magnetic order below $T_{\mathsf{N}}=15$ K manifests itself in the form of spontaneous oscillations in the time-dependent muon asymmetry signal consistent with the dipolar fields expected from the calculated muon stopping sites and the previously determined magnetic structure of barlowite. Meanwhile, in the $x=1.0$ end-member of the series---in which antiferromagnetic kagom\'e layers of Cu$^{2+}$ $S={\frac{1}{2}}$ moments are decoupled by diamagnetic Zn$^{2+}$ ions---we observe that dynamic magnetic moment fluctuations persist down to at least 50 mK, indicative of a quantum disordered ground state. We demonstrate that this crossover from a static to dynamic magnetic ground state occurs for compositions of Zn-barlowite with $x>0.5$, which bears resemblance to dynamical behaviour of the widely studied Zn-paratacamite series that contains the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite.",249
"From magnetic order to quantum disorder: a $\mu$SR study of the Zn-barlowite series of $S={\frac{1}{2}}$ kagom\'e antiferromagnets, Zn$_{x}$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_{6}$FBr",1,"This paper presents a study of the Zn-barlowite series, a class of kagom\'e antiferromagnets with spin $S = {\frac{1}{2}}$, using muon spin relaxation spectroscopy ($\mu$SR). By systematically substituting Cu ions with Zn ions in Zn$_x$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_6$FBr, the effect on magnetic order and the evolution toward quantum disorder was examined. In the parent compound Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr, long-range order of the spins is observed down to low temperatures, implying the absence of a spin liquid state. Upon Zn substitution, this order is gradually lost, and at higher Zn concentrations, the system exhibits characteristics reminiscent of a quantum spin liquid. Our $\mu$SR results suggest that the substitution of Cu with Zn strongly perturbs the local magnetic environment, and alters the magnetic couplings within the kagom\'e planes. Moreover, we observe a dramatic broadening of the Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function, which indicates the emergence of electronic inhomogeneity and the presence of magnetic fluctuations over a wide range of temperatures. Overall, the observed evolution in magnetic behavior warrants further investigation of the Zn-barlowite series as a candidate for hosting a quantum spin liquid.",195
Organometallic Wires Constructed from Transitional Metals and Anthracene: A Theoretical Study,0,"The properties of organometallic wires [TM2(Ant)] constructed with transitional metals (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn and Fe) and anthracene (Ant) are investigated by first-principles calculations. As the gap between HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) of Ant is much smaller than that of benzene (Bz), much larger charge transfer (CT) occurs between TMs and Ant, which results in much more diverse magnetic properties in [TM2(Ant)] than in [TM2(Ant)]. Particularly, [V2(Ant)] and [Cr2(Ant)] are found to be half-metallic ferromagnets. As a result of this and the better structural stability, compared with [TM(Bz)], [TM2(Ant)] (like [V2(Ant)] and [Cr2(Ant)]) may be better candidates of spintronic devices.

Furthermore, as the HOMO-LUMO gap of small pieces of graphene (SPG), such as pentacene and coronene, decreases with the increase of polycyclic number, the CT effects may also fit for the TM-SPG sandwich polymers which can also act as good spintronic materials.",164
Organometallic Wires Constructed from Transitional Metals and Anthracene: A Theoretical Study,1,"The development of organometallic wires has been an important area of research in recent years, due to their potential applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the electronic and optical properties of transitional metal-based organometallic wires constructed using anthracene as a bridging ligand. Our theoretical calculations were carried out using a density functional theory approach, and our results highlight the important role that the metal center plays in determining the electronic structure and transport properties of these wires. We found that wires constructed from transition metals with partially occupied d orbitals exhibit strong spin polarization due to the presence of localized magnetic moments. Additionally, our calculations suggest that the use of anthracene as a bridging ligand is advantageous due to the extended pi-conjugation it provides, which leads to enhanced electronic coupling between metal centers. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and functioning of organometallic wires, which could pave the way for new advances in molecular electronics.",166
"On the interplay between hypergeometric series, Fourier-Legendre expansions and Euler sums",0,"In this work we continue the investigation about the interplay between hypergeometric functions and Fourier-Legendre ($\textrm{FL}$) series expansions. In the section ""Hypergeometric series related to $\pi,\pi^2$ and the lemniscate constant"", through the FL-expansion of $\left[x(1-x)\right]^\mu$ (with $\mu+1\in\frac{1}{4}\mathbb{N}$) we prove that all the hypergeometric series $$ \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{(-1)^n(4n+1)}{p(n)}\left[\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}\right]^3,\quad \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{(4n+1)}{p(n)}\left[\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}\right]^4,$$ $$\quad \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{(4n+1)}{p(n)^2}\left[\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}\right]^4,\; \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{1}{p(n)}\left[\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}\right]^3,\; \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{1}{p(n)}\left[\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}\right]^2 $$ return rational multiples of $\frac{1}{\pi},\frac{1}{\pi^2}$ or the lemniscate constant, as soon as $p(x)$ is a polynomial fulfilling suitable symmetry constraints.

Additionally, by computing the FL-expansions of $\frac{\log x}{\sqrt{x}}$ and related functions, we show that in many cases the hypergeometric $\phantom{}_{p+1} F_{p}(\ldots , z)$ function evaluated at $z=\pm 1$ can be converted into a combination of Euler sums. In particular we perform an explicit evaluation of $$ \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2}\left[\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}\right]^2,\quad \sum_{n\geq 0}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^3}\left[\frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n}\right]^2. $$ In the section ""Twisted hypergeometric series"" we show that the conversion of some $\phantom{}_{p+1} F_{p}(\ldots,\pm 1)$ values into combinations of Euler sums, driven by FL-expansions, applies equally well to some twisted hypergeometric series, i.e. series of the form $\sum_{n\geq 0} a_n b_n$ where $a_n$ is a Stirling number of the first kind and $\sum_{n\geq 0}b_n z^n = \phantom{}_{p+1} F_{p}(\ldots;z)$.",357
"On the interplay between hypergeometric series, Fourier-Legendre expansions and Euler sums",1,"This paper investigates the intricate interplay between hypergeometric series, Fourier-Legendre expansions, and Euler sums, revealing unexpected and fascinating connections between these three prominent areas of mathematical analysis.

Hypergeometric series are a central tool in mathematical analysis and have played a pivotal role in a diverse range of areas, from combinatorics to number theory, and physics to computer science.

Fourier-Legendre expansions, on the other hand, are an essential tool for approximating functions on the interval [-1, 1], and are central to the study of partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. The interplay between hypergeometric series and Fourier-Legendre expansions has been widely studied, leading to numerous connections between these two fields.

Euler sums are a particularly intriguing object in number theory and have been studied for many years. They are defined as the alternating sum of the reciprocals of the kth powers of the integers, and their properties have been extensively studied by mathematicians.

In this paper, we explore the surprising links between these three areas of mathematical analysis. We investigate the role of Euler sums in the evaluation of certain hypergeometric series, and show how Fourier-Legendre expansions can be used to provide alternative proofs of known results in the theory of Euler sums.

Moreover, we present new results on the convergence of certain hypergeometric series, and show how these results can be used to derive new and interesting identities involving Euler sums.

Overall, this paper sheds new light on the deep connections between hypergeometric series, Fourier-Legendre expansions, and Euler sums, revealing a rich and fascinating interplay between these three areas of mathematical analysis.",267
On the kernel of the projection map $T(V)\to S(V)$,0,"If $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$, then we consider the projection from the tensor algebra to the symmetric algebra, $\rho_{T,S}:T(V)\to S(V)$.

Our main result, in $\S$1, gives a description of $\ker\rho_{T,S}$. Explicitly, we consider the ${\mathbb Z}_{\geq 2}$-graded $T(V)$-bimodule $T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ and we define $M(V)=(T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V))/W_M(V)$, where $W_M(V)$ is the subbimodule of $T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ generated by $[x,y]\otimes\xi\otimes z\wedge t-x\wedge y\otimes\xi\otimes [z,t]$, with $x,y,z,t\in V$ and $\xi\in T(V)$. $[x,y\wedge z]+[y,z\wedge x]+[z,x\wedge y]$, with $x,y,z\in V$. (If $\eta\in T(V)$ and $\xi\in T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ (or vice-versa) then $[\eta,\xi ]:=\eta\otimes\xi -\xi\otimes\eta\in T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$.) Then $M(V)$ is a ${\mathbb Z}_{\geq 2}$-graded $T(V)$-bimodule. If $\eta\in T(V)\otimes\Lambda^2(V)\otimes T(V)$ the we denote by $[\eta ]$ its class in $M(V)$. ${\bf Theorem}$ We have an exact sequence $$0\to M(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{M,T}}T(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{T,S}}S(V)\to 0,$$ where $\rho_{M,T}$ is given by $[\eta\otimes x\wedge y\otimes \xi ]\mapsto\eta\otimes [x,y]\otimes\xi$ $\forall x,y\in V$, $\eta,\xi\in T(V)$. In $\S$2 we define the graded algebra $S'(V)=T(V)/W_{S'}(V)$, where $S'(V)\subseteq T(V)$ is the ideal generated by $x\otimes y\otimes z- y\otimes z\otimes x$, $x,y,z\in V$, and we prove that there is a n exact sequence $$0\to\Lambda^{\geq 2}(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{\Lambda^{\geq 2},S'}}S'(V)\xrightarrow{\rho_{S',S}}S(V)\to 0.$$ When we consider the homogeneous parts of degree $2$ we have $M^2(V)=\Lambda^2(V)$ and $S'^2(V)=T^2(V)$. Then both short exact sequences above become $0\to\Lambda^2(V)\to T^2(V)\to S^2(V)\to 0$ where the first morphism is given by $x\wedge y\mapsto [x,y]=x\otimes y-y\otimes x$, a well known result.",420
On the kernel of the projection map $T(V)\to S(V)$,1,"In this paper, we investigate the kernel of the projection map $T(V)\to S(V)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic not equal to 2. We show that the kernel is precisely the subspace of $T(V)$ consisting of those tensors which are symmetric in each pair of indices. Moreover, we interpret this result in terms of the geometry of the Grassmannian of $r$-planes in $V$, where $r$ is the rank of the symmetric bilinear form associated to $V$.

Our approach relies on a careful analysis of the eigenvalues of an operator $L: T(V)\to T(V)$ defined by $L(T)=\operatorname{Sym}(T)-\operatorname{Alt}(T)$, where $\operatorname{Sym}$ and $\operatorname{Alt}$ denote the symmetrization and alternation operations, respectively. We use the theory of exterior algebra and linear algebra to show that $L$ is a diagonalizable operator, with eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$ occurring with multiplicity equal to the dimension of the spaces of symmetric and skew-symmetric tensors, respectively. This allows us to derive a decomposition of $T(V)$ into eigenspaces of $L$, which leads to our characterization of the kernel of the projection map.

We then turn to the Grassmannian, which is a geometric object that parametrizes $r$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. We introduce a natural symmetric bilinear form on each tangent space of the Grassmannian, which is induced by the restriction of the bilinear form associated to $V$. It turns out that the rank of this bilinear form is precisely $r$. We show that the kernel of the projection map corresponds to the set of tangent spaces at points in the Grassmannian that correspond to isotropic $r$-planes, that is, planes on which the bilinear form vanishes.

We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the study of symmetric tensors and their applications in physics and engineering. We also outline some open questions and directions for future research, which include the study of the kernel of other projection maps in tensor algebra, and the investigation of the geometry of the Grassmannian in the presence of more general bilinear forms.",354
Downlink and Uplink Energy Minimization Through User Association and Beamforming in Cloud RAN,0,"The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) concept, in which densely deployed access points (APs) are empowered by cloud computing to cooperatively support mobile users (MUs), to improve mobile data rates, has been recently proposed.

However, the high density of active (""on"") APs results in severe interference and also inefficient energy consumption. Moreover, the growing popularity of highly interactive applications with stringent uplink (UL) requirements, e.g.

network gaming and real-time broadcasting by wireless users, means that the UL transmission is becoming more crucial and requires special attention. Therefore in this paper, we propose a joint downlink (DL) and UL MU-AP association and beamforming design to coordinate interference in the C-RAN for energy minimization, a problem which is shown to be NP hard. Due to the new consideration of UL transmission, it is shown that the two state-of-the-art approaches for finding computationally efficient solutions of joint MU-AP association and beamforming considering only the DL, i.e., group-sparse optimization and relaxed-integer programming, cannot be modified in a straightforward way to solve our problem. Leveraging on the celebrated UL-DL duality result, we show that by establishing a virtual DL transmission for the original UL transmission, the joint DL and UL optimization problem can be converted to an equivalent DL problem in C-RAN with two inter-related subproblems for the original and virtual DL transmissions, respectively. Based on this transformation, two efficient algorithms for joint DL and UL MU-AP association and beamforming design are proposed, whose performances are evaluated and compared with other benchmarking schemes through extensive simulations.",267
Downlink and Uplink Energy Minimization Through User Association and Beamforming in Cloud RAN,1,"Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is an innovative architecture for wireless communication systems that leverages cloud computing techniques to optimize network performance. A fundamental aspect of C-RAN design is energy efficiency, as it is necessary to reduce energy consumption while maintaining network quality. In this paper, we propose a user association and beamforming methodology to minimize downlink and uplink energy consumption in C-RAN systems.

The proposed approach includes a two-stage optimization process for user association and beamforming. First, a user grouping algorithm is employed to form groups of users that share the same base station (BS) connection. Second, a beamforming optimization method based on the group formation is used to minimize energy consumption. This approach is beneficial as it exploits the spatial domain of the wireless channel to direct the transmission power towards the desired users, thus resulting in reduced energy consumption and improved network performance.

Simulation results show that the proposed methodology outperforms existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency and meets the required network performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in balancing the energy consumption between BSs, reducing the total energy consumption of the network, and increasing the data rate of the users. Our findings indicate that the proposed user association and beamforming methodology is a promising solution for improving energy efficiency in C-RAN systems while maintaining a high-quality network performance.

In conclusion, the proposed approach can significantly contribute to the development of energy-efficient C-RAN systems and enable the implementation of sustainable and cost-effective 5G networks.",262
On the density of states in a free CFT and finite volume corrections,0,Results from spectral geometry such as Weyl's formula can be used to relate the thermodynamic properties of a free massless field to the spatial manifold on which it is defined. We begin by calculating the free energy in two cases: manifolds posessing a boundary and spheres. The subextensive contributions allow us to test the Cardy-Verlinde formula and offer a new perspective on why it only holds in a free theory if one allows for a change in the overall coefficient. After this we derive an expression for the density of states that takes the form of a Taylor series. This series leads to an improvement over known results when the area of the manifold's boundary is nonzero but much less than the appropriate power of its volume.,130
On the density of states in a free CFT and finite volume corrections,1,"This paper investigates the density of states of a free conformal field theory (CFT) and the finite volume corrections associated with such a system. Our approach involves analyzing the spectrum of operators and their correlation functions, utilizing both analytical and numerical methods. We find that the conformal symmetry in free CFT governs the behavior of the density of states, both in the high and low energy regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in finite volumes, the density of states is corrected by spatial dependence. Specifically, we show that the spectral density oscillations around the central value and their amplitude depend on the system's size and boundary conditions. Our results provide important insights into the properties of conformal field theories and their behavior in finite volumes.",125
Asymptotics of a vanishing period : General existence theorem and basic properties of frescos,0,"In this paper we introduce the word ""fresco"" to denote a \ $[\lambda]-$primitive monogenic geometric (a,b)-module. The study of this ""basic object"" (generalized Brieskorn module with one generator) which corresponds to the minimal filtered (regular) differential equation satisfied by a relative de Rham cohomology class, began in [B.09] where the first structure theorems are proved. Then in [B.10] we introduced the notion of theme which corresponds in the \ $[\lambda]-$primitive case to frescos having a unique Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence. Themes correspond to asymptotic expansion of a given vanishing period, so to the image of a fresco in the module of asymptotic expansions. For a fixed relative de Rham cohomology class (for instance given by a smooth differential form $d-$closed and $df-$closed) each choice of a vanishing cycle in the spectral eigenspace of the monodromy for the eigenvalue \ $exp(2i\pi.\lambda)$ \ produces a \ $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, which is a quotient of the fresco associated to the given relative de Rham class itself. The first part of this paper shows that, for any \ $[\lambda]-$primitive fresco there exists an unique Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence (called the principal J-H. sequence) with corresponding quotients giving the opposite of the roots of the Bernstein polynomial in a non decreasing order.

Then we introduce and study the semi-simple part of a given fresco and we characterize the semi-simplicity of a fresco by the fact for any given order of the roots of its Bernstein polynomial we may find a J-H. sequence making them appear with this order. Then, using the parameter associated to a rank \ 2 \ \ $[\lambda]-$primitive theme, we introduce inductiveley a numerical invariant, that we call the \ $\alpha-$invariant, which depends polynomially on the isomorphism class of a fresco (in a sens which has to be defined) and which allows to give an inductive way to produce a sub-quotient rank \ 2 \ theme of a given \ $[\lambda]-$primitive fresco assuming non semi-simplicity. In the last section we prove a general existence result which naturally associate a fresco to any relative de Rham cohomology class of a proper holomorphic function of a complex manifold onto a disc. This is, of course, the motivation for the study of frescos.",378
Asymptotics of a vanishing period : General existence theorem and basic properties of frescos,1,"This paper studies the asymptotic properties of a vanishing period and presents a general existence theorem and basic properties of frescos within this context. Our main result shows the existence of a solution for a particular class of problems involving a vanishing period, and establishes a representation formula for it. The proof relies on a combination of techniques including the theory of periodic homogenization and the method of Fourier analysis.

In addition to the existence theorem, we investigate several basic properties of frescos and prove that they are a useful tool for studying the behavior of solutions near a vanishing period. Specifically, we show that frescos are uniformly bounded and have an asymptotic expansion in powers of the period that vanishes. Moreover, we explore the connection between the asymptotic behavior of frescos and the behavior of solutions of the original problem.

Our analysis has interesting applications in many fields, including elasticity, electromagnetics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Indeed, many problems in these areas can be recast as problems involving a vanishing period, and our results provide a useful framework for their analysis. For instance, we show that the behavior of wave propagation in a heterogeneous medium can be understood in terms of fresco expansions.

To conclude, the main contribution of this paper is the establishment of a general existence theorem for a class of problems involving a vanishing period, and the investigation of basic properties of frescos in this context. Our results have interesting applications and pave the way for further developments in the analysis of problems with a vanishing period.",261
Fundamental limitations for antenna radiation efficiency,0,"Small volume, finite conductivity and high frequencies are major imperatives in the design of communications infrastructure. The radiation efficiency $\eta_r$ impacts on the optimal gain, quality factor, and bandwidth. The current efficiency limit applies to structures confined to a radian sphere $ka$ ($k$ is the wave number, $a$ is the radius). Here we present new absolute limits to $\eta_r$ for arbitrary antenna shapes based on $k^2S$ where $S$ is the conductor surface area. For a dipole with an electrical length of $10^{-5}$ our result is four orders of magnitude closer to the analytical solution when compared with previous bounds on the efficiency. The improved bound on $\eta_r$ is more accurate, more general, and easier to calculate than other limits. The efficiency of an antenna cannot be larger than the case where the surface of the antenna is 'peeled' off and assembled into a planar sheet with area $S$, and a uniform current is excited along the surface of this sheet.",162

A Multi-technique Study of the Dynamical Evolution of the Viscous Disk around the Be Star {\omega} CMa,0,"There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that Be disks are well described by the Viscous Decretion Disk (VDD) model according to which the formation and structure of the disk depend on the kinematic viscosity of the gas. However, most observational tests of the VDD to-date were done for systems that do not display strong temporal variability. From this analysis we (1) obtain a realistic physical model of the circumstellar environment; (2) measure the viscosity parameter of the gas, both during the formation and dissipation phases of the disk; (3) obtain a reliable estimate of the stellar mass and angular momentum loss rates during outburst. Our simulations suggests that the VDD model adequately describes the structural evolution of the disk.

Furthermore, our analysis allowed us to determine the viscosity parameter a, as well as the net mass and angular momentum (AM) loss rates. We find that a is variable, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, not only from cycle to cycle but also within a given cycle. Additionally, build-up phases have larger values of a than the dissipation phases. We also find that, contrary to what is generally assumed, during dissipation the outward AM flux is not necessarily zero, meaning that {\omega} CMa does not experience a true quiescence but, instead, switches between a high AM loss rate state to a low AM loss rate one during which the disk quickly assumes an overall lower density but never zero. We confront the average AM loss rate with predictions from stellar evolution models for fast-rotating stars, and find that our measurements are smaller by more than one order of magnitude. The model developed using the V-band photometry as a constraint was applied to several other observables. Overall, the results of this multi-technique study were very positive, with a good match for multi-band photometry, polarization, and most spectroscopic characteristics.",316
A Multi-technique Study of the Dynamical Evolution of the Viscous Disk around the Be Star {\omega} CMa,1,"This research paper presents a multi-technique study of the dynamical evolution of the viscous disk around the Be star Ω CMa. The disk around Be stars is a well-known phenomenon in astrophysics and is thought to be caused by a rapid rotation of the star, resulting in the ejection of material from its equator.

In this study, we used a combination of spectroscopic, spectropolarimetric, and interferometric observations to explore the properties of the disk around Ω CMa. Our results show that the disk is highly structured and asymmetric, with different regions of the disk exhibiting different physical conditions.

We used the Hα line profiles to probe the disk kinematics and found that the disk is in Keplerian rotation, with a central mass of 13.2 ± 2.0 M⊙. We also found evidence of non-uniform density and velocity structures in the disk, which could be caused by the presence of spiral arms.

Our spectropolarimetric observations revealed the existence of a magnetic field in the disk, which may play an important role in its dynamics and stability. Our interferometric observations provided spatially resolved images of the disk, which showed that it is extended and clumpy, with the clumps likely caused by instabilities in the disk.

Overall, our study provides a comprehensive view of the dynamical evolution of the viscous disk around Ω CMa, revealing its complex and varied structure. This work contributes to our understanding of the physics of Be star disks and provides a valuable resource for future research in this field.",254

Our final sample consists of 44 Seyfert 1's, 29 Seyfert 1.5's, 78 Seyfert 2's, and 14 Narrow Line Seyfert 1's. We derived the average hard X-ray spectrum of each subsample in the 17-250keV energy range. All classes of Seyfert galaxies show on average the same nuclear continuum, as foreseen by the zeroth order unified model, with a cut-off energy of Ec>200keV, and a photon index of Gamma ~1.8. Compton-thin Seyfert 2's show a reflection component stronger than Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 1.5's. Most of this reflection is due to mildly obscured (10^23 cm^-2 < NH < 10^24 cm^-2) Seyfert 2's, which have a significantly stronger reflection component (R=2.2^{+4.5}_{-1.1}) than Seyfert 1's (R<=0.4), Seyfert 1.5's (R<= 0.4) and lightly obscured (NH < 10^23 cm^-2) Seyfert 2's (R<=0.5). This cannot be explained easily by the unified model. The absorber/reflector in mildly obscured Seyfert 2's might cover a large fraction of the X-ray source, and have clumps of Compton-thick material. The large reflection found in the spectrum of mildly obscured Seyfert 2's reduces the amount of Compton-thick objects needed to explain the peak of the cosmic X-ray background. Our results are consistent with the fraction of Compton-thick sources being ~10%. The spectra of Seyfert 2's with and without polarized broad lines do not show significant differences, the only difference between the two samples being the higher hard X-ray and bolometric luminosity of Seyfert 2's with polarized broad lines. The average hard X-ray spectrum of Narrow line Seyfert 1's is steeper than those of Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 1.5's, probably due to a lower energy of the cutoff.",350
Reflection in Seyfert Galaxies and the Unified Model of AGN,1,"Seyfert galaxies have been extensively studied in recent years to understand the mechanisms behind active galactic nuclei (AGN). AGN are among the brightest and most energetic sources in the universe, and their observed properties provide valuable information about the physical processes that occur in their vicinity. Reflection is a crucial component of AGN physics, as it serves as a probe of the geometry and composition of the accretion disk and the surrounding material. 

In this paper, we investigate the role of reflection in Seyfert galaxies and its relation to the unified model of AGN. The unified model posits that Seyfert galaxies and other AGN share the same underlying physical structure, but the observed differences are due to the orientation of the observer relative to the source. In particular, the model postulates the existence of an optically thick torus that obscures the central engine and the broad-line region from certain viewing angles.

We analyze a sample of Seyfert galaxies with high-quality X-ray spectra obtained by the NuSTAR satellite, which offers unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the 3-79 keV energy range. By fitting sophisticated reflection models to the data, we determine the properties of the accretion disk and the covering fraction of the torus. We find that the level of reflection varies widely among Seyfert galaxies, with some sources exhibiting strong reflection, while others show little or none. We also discover a connection between the strength of the reflection and the inclination angle of the torus, which supports the unified model. 

Our results have important implications for the nature and evolution of AGN. The diversity of the reflection properties suggests that Seyfert galaxies are not a homogenous population, and that different mechanisms may be responsible for producing the observed emission. Moreover, the correlation between reflection and orientation provides a new constraint on the geometry and properties of the torus. Further studies of larger samples of Seyfert galaxies and multiwavelength observations will help to refine our understanding of AGN physics and the unified model.",335
Near-infrared observations of type Ia supernovae: The best known standard candle for cosmology,0,"We present an analysis of the Hubble diagram for 12 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed in the near-infrared J and H bands. We select SNe exclusively from the redshift range 0.03 < z < 0.09 to reduce uncertainties coming from peculiar velocities while remaining in a cosmologically well-understood region. All of the SNe in our sample exhibit no spectral or B-band light-curve peculiarities and lie in the B-band stretch range of 0.8-1.15. Our results suggest that SNe Ia observed in the near-infrared (NIR) are the best known standard candles. We fit previously determined NIR light-curve templates to new high-precision data to derive peak magnitudes and to determine the scatter about the Hubble line.

Photometry of the 12 SNe is presented in the natural system. Using a standard cosmology of (H_0, Omega_m, Lambda) = (70,0.27,0.73) we find a median J-band absolute magnitude of M_J = -18.39 with a scatter of 0.116 and a median H-band absolute magnitude of M_H = -18.36 with a scatter of 0.085. The scatter in the H band is the smallest yet measured. We search for correlations between residuals in the J- and H-band Hubble diagrams and SN properties, such as SN colour, B-band stretch and the projected distance from host-galaxy centre. The only significant correlation is between the J-band Hubble residual and the J-H pseudo-colour. We also examine how the scatter changes when fewer points in the near-infrared are used to constrain the light curve. With a single point in the H band taken anywhere from 10 days before to 15 days after B-band maximum light and a prior on the date of H-band maximum set from the date of B-band maximum, we find that we can measure distances to an accuracy of 6%. The precision of SNe Ia in the NIR provides new opportunities for precision measurements of both the expansion history of the universe and peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies.",345
Near-infrared observations of type Ia supernovae: The best known standard candle for cosmology,1,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are known to be the most reliable ""standard candles"" used in cosmology. These type of supernovae reach an extremely high temperature and brightness, and their light curves are easily observable at both visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Despite this, the wavelength range of the observations of SNe Ia has not always been optimized for maximum efficiency. In recent years, observations in the near-infrared (NIR) have proven to be particularly beneficial for improving the cosmological accuracy of SNe Ia, leading to a more precise measurement of the expansion rate of the universe.

NIR observations provide a number of advantages in comparison to visible light observations. These benefits include lower extinction due to dust, a reduced dependence on the host galaxy's metallicity, and a smaller impact of intrinsic variations in the spectral features of SNe Ia on their observed flux. Additionally, NIR observations can be used to identify SNe Ia at higher redshifts, beyond the capability of optical telescopes, allowing for the study of the distribution of dark matter and dark energy in the universe.

Several research teams have now successfully used NIR observations to identify and classify SNe Ia. Initial results from these studies suggest that NIR observations may produce more accurate determinations of the distance modulus and other cosmological parameters. These new measurements have the potential to uncover new information about the universe, such as precise constraints on the equation of state of dark energy and the evolution of dark matter.

While NIR observations have proven to be a powerful tool for cosmologists, they are not without their limitations. For example, the collection of NIR data is more uniquely challenging than visible light observations, requiring larger detectors and longer exposure times. However, NIR observations of SNe Ia have already demonstrated their efficacy, and future studies are expected to make full use of this powerful tool.

Overall, the application of NIR observations has led to significant progress in determining cosmological parameters. As such, complete surveys using NIR observations of SNe Ia will be essential for the future of precision cosmology.",346
"Physics case for an LHCb Upgrade II - Opportunities in flavour physics, and beyond, in the HL-LHC era",0,"The LHCb Upgrade II will fully exploit the flavour-physics opportunities of the HL-LHC, and study additional physics topics that take advantage of the forward acceptance of the LHCb spectrometer. The LHCb Upgrade I will begin operation in 2020. Consolidation will occur, and modest enhancements of the Upgrade I detector will be installed, in Long Shutdown 3 of the LHC (2025) and these are discussed here. The main Upgrade II detector will be installed in long shutdown 4 of the LHC (2030) and will build on the strengths of the current LHCb experiment and the Upgrade I. It will operate at a luminosity up to $ 2 \times 10^{34} \rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}$, ten times that of the Upgrade I detector. New detector components will improve the intrinsic performance of the experiment in certain key areas. An Expression Of Interest proposing Upgrade II was submitted in February 2017. The physics case for the Upgrade II is presented here in more depth. $CP$-violating phases will be measured with precisions unattainable at any other envisaged facility. The experiment will probe $b\to s \ell^+\ell^-$ and $b\to d \ell^+\ell^-$ transitions in both muon and electron decays in modes not accessible at Upgrade I. Minimal flavour violation will be tested with a precision measurement of the ratio of $B(B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)/B(B_s^0\to \mu^+\mu^-)$. Probing charm $CP$ violation at the $10^{-5}$ level may result in its long sought discovery. Major advances in hadron spectroscopy will be possible, which will be powerful probes of low energy QCD. Upgrade II potentially will have the highest sensitivity of all the LHC experiments on the Higgs to charm-quark couplings. Generically, the new physics mass scale probed, for fixed couplings, will almost double compared with the pre-HL-LHC era; this extended reach for flavour physics is similar to that which would be achieved by the HE-LHC proposal for the energy frontier.",328
"Physics case for an LHCb Upgrade II - Opportunities in flavour physics, and beyond, in the HL-LHC era",1,"The LHCb collaboration is planning an upgrade to its detector and data acquisition system, which will enable the experiment to collect data at an unprecedented rate at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). In this paper, we present the physics case for this upgrade, focusing on the opportunities it will provide for studies of flavour physics and beyond in the HL-LHC era.

Flavour physics is the study of the properties of particles that determine their decays, and it provides a unique window into new physics beyond the Standard Model. The LHCb experiment has already made significant contributions to this field, and the upgrade will allow us to explore even rarer and more subtle phenomena. With the upgraded detector, we will be able to measure with greater precision the decays of b-hadrons, which are rich in flavour-changing neutral currents, and investigate the patterns of CP violation in these decays. In addition, we will be able to search for evidence of new particles and interactions that could explain some of the puzzles in flavour physics, such as the observed excess of matter over antimatter in the universe.

Beyond flavour physics, the upgraded LHCb detector will open up new opportunities in other areas of particle physics. With its improved particle identification and tracking, it will be able to study rare processes involving kaons and rare tau decays, providing complementary information to experiments at other colliders. The upgraded detector will also be sensitive to a wide range of exotic particles, including dark matter candidates, sterile neutrinos, and axion-like particles, which could reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model.

In conclusion, the LHCb Upgrade II presents a compelling physics case for exploring the frontiers of particle physics in the HL-LHC era. With its improved capabilities for studying flavour physics and beyond, it will make a unique contribution to the worldwide effort to understand the fundamental nature of the universe.",319
On torque computation in electric machine simulation by harmonic mortar methods,0,"The use of trigonometric polynomials as Lagrange multipliers in the harmonic mortar method enables an efficient and elegant treatment of relative motion in the stator-rotor coupling of electric machine simulation. Explicit formulas for the torque computation are derived by energetic considerations, and their realization by harmonic mortar finite element and isogemetric analysis discretizations is discussed. Numerical tests are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the potential of harmonic mortar methods for the evaluation of torque ripples.",79
On torque computation in electric machine simulation by harmonic mortar methods,1,"This paper presents a novel approach to torque computation in electric machine simulation using harmonic mortar methods. Specifically, we propose a new formulation based on the mortar element method that yields accurate and efficient results, even for high-order geometries.

Our findings have important implications for the design and optimization of electric machines for various industrial applications.",78
Inequalities for the Hodge numbers of irregular compact Kaehler manifolds,0,"Based on work of R. Lazarsfeld and M. Popa, we use the derivative complex associated to the bundle of the holomorphic p-forms to provide inequalities for all the Hodge numbers of a special class of irregular compact Kaehler manifolds. For 3-folds and 4-folds we give an asymptotic bound for all the Hodge numbers in terms of the irregularity. As a byproduct, via the BGG correspondence, we also bound the regularity of the exterior cohomology modules of bundles of holomorphic p-forms.",84
Inequalities for the Hodge numbers of irregular compact Kaehler manifolds,1,"This research article presents new inequalities for the Hodge numbers of irregular compact Kaehler manifolds. The main result of the study details the relationship between the Hodge numbers and the dimension of the manifold, and demonstrates how this relationship affects the overall algebraic topology of such manifolds. We prove the inequalities using a combination of geometric and algebraic techniques, yielding novel insights into the structure of these manifolds. This work has broad implications for algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and topology, and represents a significant contribution to the field.",88
New first trimester crown-rump length's equations optimized by structured data collection from a French general population,0,"--- Objectives --- Prior to foetal karyotyping, the likelihood of Down's syndrome is often determined combining maternal age, serum free beta-HCG, PAPP-A levels and embryonic measurements of crown-rump length and nuchal translucency for gestational ages between 11 and 13 weeks. It appeared important to get a precise knowledge of these scan parameters' normal values during the first trimester. This paper focused on crown-rump length. --- METHODS --- 402 pregnancies from in-vitro fertilization allowing a precise estimation of foetal ages (FA) were used to determine the best model that describes crown-rump length (CRL) as a function of FA. Scan measures by a single operator from 3846 spontaneous pregnancies representative of the general population from Northern France were used to build a mathematical model linking FA and CRL in a context as close as possible to normal scan screening used in Down's syndrome likelihood determination. We modeled both CRL as a function of FA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and performed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions.

The results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the best predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and predicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed to model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a polynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous pregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective datations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of our model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal (1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal age. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and offers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth abnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a good modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population allowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the ultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and predict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age). Our results open the way to the detection of foetal growth abnormalities using CRL Zscores throughout the first trimester.",401
New first trimester crown-rump length's equations optimized by structured data collection from a French general population,1,"In this study, we present our findings in creating new first trimester crown-rump length equations that have been optimized through structured data collection from a French general population. Early prenatal care is essential in ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the fetus. One crucial aspect of early prenatal care is the accurate measurement of the crown-rump length (CRL) of the fetus, which is used to estimate the gestational age of the fetus.

We aimed to develop new CRL equations that were optimized through structured data collection from a French general population. Our dataset consisted of 4,893 pregnant women who underwent routine ultrasound examinations during their first trimester. We gathered data on the CRL and gestational age of these women and developed new equations based on this data.

Our results showed that the CRL equations we developed were more accurate and precise in estimating gestational age than the currently used equations. Furthermore, our equations performed better across a wide range of gestational ages, which makes them more applicable to a diverse population.

One of the most significant contributions of our study is the use of a French general population in the optimization of the CRL equations. Previous studies have focused on specific subpopulations, which limits the applicability of the equations developed. By using a general population, our equations are more generalizable and applicable to a wider population.

Overall, our study provides new CRL equations that are optimized using structured data collection from a French general population. These equations are more accurate and precise in estimating gestational age and are applicable to a diverse population. Our findings have implications for early prenatal care, as accurate gestational age estimation is crucial in ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the fetus.",296
A MIKE + UVES survey of Sub-Damped Lyman-Alpha Systems at z<1.5,0,"We have combined the results from our recent observations of Damped and sub-Damped Lyman-alpha systems with the MIKE and UVES spectrographs on the Magellan Clay and VLT Kueyen telescopes with ones from the literature to determine the N(HI)-weighted mean metallicity of these systems based both on Fe, a depleted element in QSO absorbers and the local ISM, and Zn a relatively undepleted element. In each case, the N(HI)-weighted mean metallicity is higher and shows faster evolution in sub-DLAs than the classical DLA systems. Large grids of photoionisation models over the sub-DLA \nhI range with CLOUDY show that the ionisation corrections to the abundances are in general small, however the fraction of ionized H can be up to ~90 per cent. The individual spectra have been shifted to the rest frame of the absorber and averaged together to determine the average properties of these systems at z<1.5. We find that the average abundance pattern of the Sub-DLA systems is similar to the gas in the halo of the Milky Way, with an offset of ~0.3 dex in the overall metallicity.

Both DLAs and Sub-DLAs show similar characteristics in their relative abundances patterns, although the DLAs have smaller <[Mn/Zn]> as well as higher <[Ti/Zn]> and <[Cr/Zn]>. We calculate the contribution of sub-DLAs to the metal budget of the Universe, and find that the sub-DLA systems at z<1.5 contain a comoving density of metals Omega_met (3.5-15.8)x10^{5} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, at least twice the comoving density of metals in the DLA systems. The sub-DLAs do however track global chemical evolution models much more closely than do the DLAs, perhaps indicating that they are a less dust biased metallicity indicator of galaxies at high redshifts than the DLA systems.",310
A MIKE + UVES survey of Sub-Damped Lyman-Alpha Systems at z<1.5,1,"Recent observations indicate that low-mass galaxies may play a crucial role in the star formation history of the universe. In this context, we present a survey of sub-damped Lyman-Alpha (sub-DLA) systems at redshifts z<1.5, tracing the neutral gas content of low-mass galaxies and their role in galaxy evolution. Our survey is based on the combination of two samples, the MIKE and UVES samples, which consist of high-resolution spectroscopic data taken with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) instruments, respectively. Our analysis shows that sub-DLA systems are primarily associated with low-mass galaxies, implying that these galaxies play a crucial role in the process of galaxy evolution by serving as reservoirs of neutral gas.

We apply a bayesian model comparison approach to show that these systems are consistent with a simple model of homogeneous, turbulent gas occupying a spherically-symmetric region within the host galaxy. Our analysis also reveals a correlation between the kinematics of the sub-DLA absorption features and the galaxy, suggesting that the sub-DLA systems are intimately tied to the host galaxy's overall properties. We also investigate the impact of sub-DLA systems on the intergalactic medium (IGM) and find that their contribution to the overall HI content of the IGM is small, indicating that sub-DLAs are unlikely to play a dominant role in cosmic reionization. Overall, our study sheds new light on the connection between low-mass galaxies and the neutral gas content of the universe, providing crucial insights into the processes governing galaxy evolution and the history of the universe.",274
Quotients of exact categories by cluster tilting subcategories as module categories,0,"We prove that some subquotient categories of exact categories are abelian.

This generalizes a result by Koenig-Zhu in the case of (algebraic) triangulated categories. As a particular case, if an exact category B with enough projectives and injectives has a cluster tilting subcategory M, then B/M is abelian. More precisely, it is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules over the stable category of M.",68
Quotients of exact categories by cluster tilting subcategories as module categories,1,"We study the quotient categories of exact categories by cluster tilting subcategories, which are naturally module categories. We investigate the relationship between these categories and their cluster-tilting objects, showing that such objects act as generators. Our work leads to a complete understanding of the homological properties of these categories, including their Auslander-Reiten theory and the shape of their singularity categories.",62
Curvature-driven migration of colloids on lipid bilayers,0,"Colloids and proteins alike can bind to lipid bilayers and move laterally in these two-dimensional fluids. Inspired by proteins that generate membrane curvature, sense the underlying membrane geometry, and migrate to high curvature sites, we explore the question: Can colloids, adhered to lipid bilayers, also sense and respond to membrane geometry? We report the curvature migration of Janus microparticles adhered to giant unilamellar vesicles elongated to present well defined curvature fields. However, unlike proteins, which migrate to minimize membrane bending energy, colloids migrate by an entirely different mechanism. By determining the energy dissipated along a trajectory, the energy field mediating these interactions is inferred to be linear in the local deviatoric curvature, as reported previously for colloids trapped at curved interfaces between immiscible fluids. In this latter system, however, the energy gradients are far larger, so particles move deterministically, whereas the colloids on vesicles move with significant fluctuations in regions of weak curvature gradient. By addressing the role of Brownian motion, we show that the observed curvature migration of colloids on bilayers is indeed a case of curvature capillary migration, with membrane tension playing the role of interfacial tension. Furthermore, since this motion is mediated by membrane tension and shape, it can be modulated, or even turned ""on"" and ""off"", by simply varying these parameters. While particle-particle interactions on lipid membranes have been considered in many contributions, we report here an exciting and previously unexplored modality to actively direct the migration of colloids to desired locations on lipid bilayers.",251
Curvature-driven migration of colloids on lipid bilayers,1,"This research work investigates the curvature-driven migration of colloids on lipid bilayers. The interaction between colloids and lipid bilayers has gained significant attention in recent years. The curvature of the lipid bilayers acts as a driving force for colloidal migration, but the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon is not well-understood. By using microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, this study showcases the experimental results of the colloids' dynamic migration on model lipid bilayers.

The outcome of the experiments indicates that the curvature of the lipid bilayers creates gradients in the lateral energy landscape that act as a driving force, leading to the migration of colloids. The migration speed of the colloids is found to increase with the lipid bilayer's curvature, with greater curvature causing faster migration rates. The use of different types of colloids in the experiments helped to elucidate this phenomenon.

This research contributes to our understanding of the interplay between lipid bilayers and colloidal particles, and it opens up new possibilities for the development of colloidal transport devices. It has implications in diverse areas of research, such as biomimetic systems, drug delivery, and pore formation in biological membranes. These findings have significant implications for the design of synthetic systems that mimic the function and behavior of biological systems. Overall, this study provides a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of colloidal migration in lipid bilayers and opens up new possibilities for the development of novel applications in the field of materials science.",244
The biomechanical properties of F1C pili,0,"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) express various kinds of organelles, so-called pili or fimbriae, that mediate adhesion to host tissue in the urinary tract through specific receptor-adhesin interactions. The biomechanical properties of these pili have been considered important for the ability of bacteria to withstand shear forces from rinsing urine flows. Force measuring optical tweezers have been used to characterize individual organelles of F1C type expressed by UPEC bacteria with respect to such properties. Qualitatively, the force-vs.-elongation response was found to be similar to that of other types of helix-like pili expressed by UPEC, i.e. type 1, P, and S, with force-induced elongation in three regions of which one represents the important uncoiling mechanism of the helix-like quaternary structure. Quantitatively, the steady-state uncoiling force was assessed to 26.4(1.4) pN, which is similar to those of other pili (which range from 21 pN for SI to 30 pN for type 1). The corner velocity for dynamic response (1400 nm/s) was found to be larger than those of the other pili (400 -700 nm/s for S and P pili, and 6 nm/s for type 1). The kinetics were found to be faster, with a thermal opening rate of 17 Hz, a few times higher than S and P pili, and three orders of magnitude times higher than type 1. These data suggest that F1C pili are, like P and S pili, evolutionary-selected to primarily withstand the conditions expressed in the upper urinary tract.",256
The biomechanical properties of F1C pili,1,"F1C pili are filamentous surface appendages produced by bacteria that play a crucial role in biofilm formation and bacterial pathogenesis. Understanding the biomechanical properties of F1C pili is key to developing strategies to prevent bacterial infections. In this study, we characterized the mechanical behavior of F1C pili using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). Our AFM experiments revealed that F1C pili exhibit a nonlinear force-extension behavior, with a characteristic sawtooth pattern that suggests a modular structure. Using MDS, we predicted that the mechanical stability of F1C pili arises from the cooperation of individual pilin subunits and their interactions with the solvent and other biomolecules. We also found that the presence of calcium ions enhances the mechanical properties of F1C pili, possibly due to the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular bonds. Our results provide new insights into the biomechanics of F1C pili and pave the way to the rational design of novel antibacterial agents targeting these key virulence determinants. Additionally, our methodology can be extended to study other important pili systems and protein assemblies in the field of molecular biomechanics.",183
Local recoil of extended solitons: a string theory example,0,"It is well-known that localized topological defects (solitons) experience recoil when they suffer an impact by incident particles. Higher-dimensional topological defects develop distinctive wave patterns propagating along their worldvolume under similar circumstances. For 1-dimensional topological defects (vortex lines), these wave patterns fail to decay in the asymptotic future: the propagating wave eventually displaces the vortex line a finite distance away from its original position (the distance is proportional to the transferred momentum). The quantum version of this phenomenon, which we call ``local recoil'', can be seen as a simple geometric manifestation of the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1+1 dimensions. Analogously to soliton recoil, local recoil of vortex lines is associated with infrared divergences in perturbative expansions. In perturbative string theory, such divergences appear in amplitudes for closed strings scattering off a static D1-brane. Through a Dirac-Born-Infeld analysis, it is possible to resum these divergences in a way that yields finite, momentum-conserving amplitudes.",162
Local recoil of extended solitons: a string theory example,1,"We investigate the phenomenon of local recoil in extended solitons, focusing on a particular example from string theory. Solitons are stable solutions of nonlinear field equations that can propagate without changing their shape, and they can play an important role in many areas of physics. In the case of extended solitons, such as strings or membranes, we show that they can experience a localized recoil when they encounter a defect in their environment. We analyze the dynamics of this process and derive an expression for the recoil velocity in terms of the properties of the soliton and the defect. We use our results to discuss potential applications in string theory and related fields, such as the study of cosmic strings or the behavior of branes in higher-dimensional spaces. Our work provides new insights into the dynamical behavior of extended solitons and their interactions with their surroundings.",147
Groupes analytiques rigides p-divisibles II,0,"Let $K$ be a $p$-adic field. We continue to develop the theory of rigid analytic $p$-divisible groups over $K$. For example, we explain how to find back the category of Banach-Colmez spaces from rigid analytic $p$-divisible groups ""in finite level"" without perfectoid spaces. We then establish some results about families of rigid analytic $p$-divisible groups. This allows us to prove a ""minimality"" result in the sense of birationnal geometry for integral models of unramified Rapoport-Zink spaces.",82
Groupes analytiques rigides p-divisibles II,1,"Building upon the work from the first part of the paper, this article continues the study of rigid analytic groups of p-divisible type. Specifically, we investigate the moduli space of p-divisible groups associated to such groups. We introduce a new construction of these groups, which yields interesting algebraic properties inherited from the original rigid analytic group. The main objects of study are the Newton strata in these moduli spaces, and their description allows us to obtain new results in the arithmetic of these groups.",86
The {-3}-reconstruction and the {-3}-self duality of tournaments,0,"Let T = (V,A) be a (finite) tournament and k be a non negative integer. For every subset X of V is associated the subtournament T[X] = (X,A\cap (X \timesX)) of T, induced by X. The dual tournament of T, denoted by T\ast, is the tournament obtained from T by reversing all its arcs. The tournament T is self dual if it is isomorphic to its dual. T is {-k}-self dual if for each set X of k vertices, T[V \ X] is self dual. T is strongly self dual if each of its induced subtournaments is self dual. A subset I of V is an interval of T if for a, b \in I and for x \in V \ I, (a,x) \in A if and only if (b,x) \in A. For instance, \varnothing, V and {x}, where x \in V, are intervals of T called trivial intervals. T is indecomposable if all its intervals are trivial; otherwise, it is decomposable. A tournament T', on the set V, is {-k}-hypomorphic to T if for each set X on k vertices, T[V \ X] and T'[V \ X] are isomorphic. The tournament T is {-k}-reconstructible if each tournament {-k}-hypomorphic to T is isomorphic to it. Suppose that T is decomposable and | V |\geq 9. In this paper, we begin by proving the equivalence between the {-3}-self duality and the strong self duality of T. Then we characterize each tournament {-3}-hypomorphic to T. As a consequence of this characterization, we prove that if there is no interval X of T such that T[X] is indecomposable and | V \ X |\leq 2, then T is {-3}-reconstructible. Finally, we conclude by reducing the {-3}-reconstruction problem to the indecomposable case (between a tournament and its dual). In particular, we find and improve, in a less complicated way, the results of [6] found by Y. Boudabbous and A. Boussairi.",327
The {-3}-reconstruction and the {-3}-self duality of tournaments,1,"In this paper, we investigate the concept of the {-3}-reconstruction and the {-3}-self duality of tournaments. Tournaments are directed graphs where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a single directed edge. They are widely used in modeling real-life situations in areas such as sports, politics, and economics. A {-3}-tournament is a tournament where every 3-cycle has a unique chord, meaning that it has a unique directed path connecting two non-adjacent vertices of the cycle. In the {-3}-reconstruction problem, we aim to reconstruct a labeled tournament from the multiset of lengths of its paths of length three.

We first determine the conditions for a tournament to be a {-3}-tournament. We then establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a multiset of integers to be the multiset of lengths of paths of length three in a {-3}-tournament. Using these results, we provide an algorithm for reconstructing a labeled {-3}-tournament from its multiset of path lengths and prove that the algorithm is correct.

Next, we investigate the concept of {-3}-self duality of tournaments. A tournament is {\tau-self dual} if there exists an automorphism of the tournament that takes every vertex to its complement with respect to $\tau$. We give a criterion for determining whether a tournament is {-3}-self dual, and show that this criterion also holds for the classes of transitive, regular, and strongly connected tournaments. Lastly, we provide a construction for {\tau}-self dual {-3}-tournaments with an even number of vertices.

Our results have implications in the fields of graph theory, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. Specifically, they can be used to analyze and model real-life situations such as voting systems, sports tournaments, and social networks.",291
From core collapse to superluminous: The rates of massive stellar explosions from the Palomar Transient Factory,0,"We present measurements of the local core collapse supernova (SN) rate using SN discoveries from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We use a Monte Carlo simulation of hundreds of millions of SN light curve realizations coupled with the detailed PTF survey detection efficiencies to forward-model the SN rates in PTF. Using a sample of 86 core collapse SNe, including 26 stripped-envelope SNe (SESNe), we show that the overall core collapse SN volumetric rate is $r^\mathrm{CC}_v=9.10_{-1.27}^{+1.56}\times10^{-5}\,\text{SNe yr}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-3}\, h_{70}^{3}$ at $ \langle z \rangle = 0.028$, and the SESN volumetric rate is $r^\mathrm{SE}_v=2.41_{-0.64}^{+0.81}\times10^{-5}\, \text{SNe yr}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-3}\, h_{70}^{3}$. We further measure a volumetric rate for hydrogen-free superluminous SNe (SLSNe-I) using 8 events at $z{\le}0.2$ of $r^\mathrm{SLSN-I}_v=35_{-13}^{+25}\, \text{SNe yr}^{-1}\text{Gpc}^{-3}\, h_{70}^{3}$, which represents the most precise SLSN-I rate measurement to date.

Using a simple cosmic star-formation history to adjust these volumetric rate measurements to the same redshift, we measure a local ratio of SLSN-I to SESN of $\sim1/810^{+1500}_{-94}$, and of SLSN-I to all CCSN types of $\sim 1/3500^{+2800}_{-720}$. However, using host galaxy stellar mass as a proxy for metallicity, we also show that this ratio is strongly metallicity dependent: in low-mass ($\mathrm{log} M_{*} < 9.5 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) galaxies, which are the only environments that host SLSN-I in our sample, we measure a SLSN-I to SESN fraction of $1/300^{+380}_{-170}$ and $1/1700^{+1800}_{-720}$ for all CCSN. We further investigate the SN rates a function of host galaxy stellar mass and show that the specific rates of all core collapse SNe decrease with increasing stellar mass.",329
From core collapse to superluminous: The rates of massive stellar explosions from the Palomar Transient Factory,1,"The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a wide-field optical survey designed to systematically explore the transient and variable sky. In this paper, we present the rates of massive stellar explosions observed by PTF. These include core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Type IIb supernovae, and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe).

We analyzed a sample of 108 CCSNe, which constitute the largest sample of core-collapse events observed by a single survey to date. We also found 11 Type IIb SNe, which represent a rare subtype of CCSNe that exhibit a hydrogen-poor envelope. Additionally, we discovered 17 SLSNe, which are extremely bright explosions that cannot be explained by conventional models of supernovae.

We used a statistical approach to estimate the rates of these events, corrected for the survey efficiency and selection biases. We found that the rate of CCSNe is 2.73 ± 0.09 events per century per 10^10 solar masses, which is consistent with previous measurements. The rate of Type IIb SNe is much lower at 0.26 ± 0.06 events per century per 10^10 solar masses, while the rate of SLSNe is even lower at 0.31 ± 0.06 events per century per 10^10 solar masses.

Overall, our results provide important constraints on the rates of massive stellar explosions in the local universe, and have implications for the understanding of the final stages of the evolution of massive stars. The large sample of CCSNe observed by PTF enables us to study the properties of these events in more detail, and to explore the diversity in their observational characteristics. The discovery of Type IIb SNe and SLSNe by PTF contributes to the growing field of exotic explosions, and highlights the need for further theoretical and observational studies.",288
Towards Human Computable Passwords,0,"An interesting challenge for the cryptography community is to design authentication protocols that are so simple that a human can execute them without relying on a fully trusted computer. We propose several candidate authentication protocols for a setting in which the human user can only receive assistance from a semi-trusted computer --- a computer that stores information and performs computations correctly but does not provide confidentiality. Our schemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges $C_i\in[n]^k$. The human user memorizes a random secret mapping $\sigma:[n]\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ and authenticates by computing responses $f(\sigma(C_i))$ to a sequence of public challenges where $f:\mathbb{Z}_d^k\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a function that is easy for the human to evaluate. We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample $m=\tilde{\Omega}(n^{s(f)})$ challenge-response pairs to recover $\sigma$, for a security parameter $s(f)$ that depends on two key properties of $f$. To obtain our results, we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower bound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response pairs induced by $f$ and $\sigma$. Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary functions $f $ (not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate), and generalize recent results of Feldman et al. As an application, we propose a family of human computable password functions $f_{k_1,k_2}$ in which the user needs to perform $2k_1+2k_2+1$ primitive operations (e.g., adding two digits or remembering $\sigma(i)$), and we show that $s(f) = \min\{k_1+1, (k_2+1)/2\}$.

For these schemes, we prove that forging passwords is equivalent to recovering the secret mapping. Thus, our human computable password schemes can maintain strong security guarantees even after an adversary has observed the user login to many different accounts.",310
Towards Human Computable Passwords,1,"Passwords are ubiquitous in our digital lives, serving as the gateway to a multitude of sensitive information. However, traditional alphanumeric passwords have become increasingly vulnerable to attacks by hackers. In response, researchers have begun exploring alternative authentication measures that are both secure and user-friendly. One such innovation is the concept of human computable passwords. 

Human computable passwords leverage the unique cognitive abilities of humans to create robust and easily remembered passwords. These passwords incorporate elements of randomness, requiring users to identify patterns and complete tasks that are intuitive for humans but difficult for machines. By harnessing the power of human cognition, human computable passwords are less vulnerable to attacks that rely on automated brute force or dictionary attacks. 

To date, research in this area has focused on optimizing the usability and security of human computable passwords. One key challenge is ensuring that users can effectively create and remember these passwords, especially across multiple accounts. Researchers have explored various mechanisms, such as creating visual mnemonics or using personalized stories, to facilitate this process. 

In addition to its potential as a secure, user-friendly authentication mechanism, human computable passwords may also have implications for fields such as cryptography and cognitive psychology. For example, some researchers have proposed leveraging human computable password schemes to support secure multi-party computation and to create secure computational protocols that are resilient to adversaries. Furthermore, the study of human computable passwords can provide insights into the cognitive processes that underlie human information processing and memory. 

In conclusion, human computable passwords represent a promising innovation in the field of secure authentication. The development of user-friendly and robust human computable password schemes has the potential to enhance security across a broad range of digital applications. Continued research in this area will bring us closer to realizing this promising potential.",302
"Fine-Grained, Language-Based Access Control for Database-Backed Applications",0,"Context: Database-backed applications often run queries with more authority than necessary. Since programs can access more data than they legitimately need, flaws in security checks at the application level can enable malicious or buggy code to view or modify data in violation of intended access control policies.

Inquiry: Although database management systems provide tools to control access to data, these tools are not well-suited for modern applications which often have many users and consist of many different software components. First, databases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user for each application user is impractical for applications with many users.

Second, different components of the same application may require different authority, which would require creating different database users for different software components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly limit the authority an application has when executing queries. For this reason, we consider a new, language-based approach to application-specific database security.

Approach: Prior work has addressed the difficulty of running applications with least privilege using capability-based security and software contracts, which we adapt to the setting of database-backed applications.

Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of ShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB enables reasoning about database access at the language level through capabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and contracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables.

ShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy to specify different access control policies for different components.

Contracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are enforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access control guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms of the underlying database management system.

Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to implement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts for each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB.

Further, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to better understand the language's performance overhead.

Importance: Our experience indicates that ShillDB is a practical language for enforcing database access control policies in realistic, multi-user applications and has reasonable performance overhead. ShillDB allows developers to reason about security at the component level, safely compose components, and reuse third-party components with their own application-specific database security policies.",409
"Fine-Grained, Language-Based Access Control for Database-Backed Applications",1,"Fine-grained, language-based access control for database-backed applications refers to a security mechanism that offers database access based on predefined language constructs. The aim of this research paper is to investigate the effectiveness of fine-grained access control in enforcing data privacy and security. 

This study was motivated by the need to control and manage access to sensitive data stored in database-backed applications. Malicious actors continually look for ways to exploit vulnerabilities in software systems to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. Access control, therefore, is necessary to prevent unauthorized access and protect data privacy.

We conducted a comprehensive review of the existing literature on access control mechanisms for database-backed applications. Existing approaches rely on coarse-grained access control that grants privileges to large user groups. However, as databases become more complex and contain more sensitive information, the need for more fine-grained access control becomes critical.

We propose a fine-grained access control mechanism that is based on the constructs of the programming language used to develop the application. This approach leverages the familiarity of developers with the programming language and its constructs to enforce access control. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a prototype application that implements our mechanism.

The prototype application was subject to various simulated attack scenarios to test the security and effectiveness of the fine-grained access control mechanism. The results of our experiments show that fine-grained access control based on language constructs effectively prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Furthermore, our proposed mechanism does not require extensive modifications to the application code or the database structure. Instead, it uses the existing programming constructs, making it easier to integrate with existing applications. 

In summary, the proposed fine-grained, language-based access control mechanism offers significant improvements over the traditional coarse-grained access control. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is effective in enforcing data privacy and security and does not require extensive changes to the database schema. We believe that our approach could be easily adopted by software developers to improve the security of their applications and databases.",352
Characterization of the electronic properties of YB$_4$ and YB$_6$ using $^{11}$B NMR and first-principles calculations,0,"Two compounds, tetragonal YB$_4$ and cubic YB$_6$, have been investigated by electric-field gradient (EFG) and Knight shift measurements at the boron sites using the $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique and by performing first-principles calculations. In YB$_6$ $^{11}$B ($I=3/2$) NMR spectra reveal patterns typical for an axially symmetric field gradient with a quadrupole coupling frequency of $\nu_Q=600\pm15$ kHz. In the second boride (YB$_4$) three different EFGs were observed corresponding to the three inequivalent crystallographic sites for the boron atoms ($4h$, $4e$, and $8j$). They correspond to: $\nu_Q(4h)=700\pm30$ kHz with an asymmetry parameter $\eta=0.02\pm0.02$, $\nu_Q(4e)=515\pm30$ kHz, $\eta=0.00+0.02/-0.00$, and $\nu_Q(8j)=515\pm40$ kHz, $\eta=0.46\pm0.08$. The Knight shifts measured by Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR at room temperature are very small being $0.6\pm8$ ppm and $-1\pm8$ ppm for YB$_4$ and YB$_6$, respectively. For the theoretical calculations structure optimizations were performed as a first step. For the obtained structural parameters the EFGs were computed within the local-density approximation. Very satisfactory agreement between experimental and theoretical results is obtained both for the structural parameters and the B EFGs thus confirming the underlying structural models. In addition to the EFGs, band structures, densities of states, and valence-electron densities are presented and the bonding situation in the two yttrium borides is discussed.

The band-structure results are compatible with the very low values for the Knight shifts mentioned above.",262
Characterization of the electronic properties of YB$_4$ and YB$_6$ using $^{11}$B NMR and first-principles calculations,1,"The electronic properties of YB$_4$ and YB$_6$ have been characterized in this study using $^{11}$B NMR and first-principles calculations. Our findings show that YB$_4$ and YB$_6$ exhibit distinguishable NMR signals, which we attribute to the different environments experienced by the B atoms within their respective crystal structures. From our first-principles calculations, we have elucidated the nature of the electronic states at the Fermi level of YB$_4$ and YB$_6$, which are shown to be predominantly derived from the B $p$ orbitals, with an admixture of Y $d$ states. The calculated density of states also reveals that YB$_4$ and YB$_6$ exhibit metallic behavior with a small overlap of the B $p$ bands at the Fermi level, suggesting weak B-B interactions. Our results are consistent with previous experimental findings, and provide further insight into the nature of the electronic properties of these two ytterbium borides. Our study could help pave the way for the design and discovery of new boride materials with interesting physical properties. Future work should continue to explore the electronic and magnetic properties of these materials, including both their bulk and surface properties, which could have important technological implications. Overall, this study contributes to a broader understanding of the electronic structure and bonding of boride materials.",218
"Vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard: Reduced models, mobility synthesis, and acoustical radiation regime",0,"In string musical instruments, the sound is radiated by the soundboard, subject to the strings excitation. This vibration of this rather complex structure is described here with models which need only a small number of parameters. Predictions of the models are compared with results of experiments that have been presented in Ege et al. [Vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard: (Non)linearity and modal properties in the low- and mid- frequency ranges, Journal of Sound and Vibration 332 (5) (2013) 1288-1305]. The apparent modal density of the soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, as seen from various points of the structure, exhibits two well-separated regimes, below and above a frequency flim that is determined by the wood characteristics and by the distance between ribs. Above flim, most modes appear to be localised, presumably due to the irregularity of the spacing and height of the ribs. The low-frequency regime is predicted by a model which consists of coupled sub-structures: the two ribbed areas split by the main bridge and, in most cases, one or two so-called cut-off corners. In order to assess the dynamical properties of each of the subplates (considered here as homogeneous plates), we propose a derivation of the (low-frequency) modal density of an orthotropic homogeneous plate which accounts for the boundary conditions on an arbitrary geometry. Above flim, the soundboard, as seen from a given excitation point, is modelled as a set of three structural wave-guides, namely the three inter-rib spacings surrounding the excitation point. Based on these low- and high-frequency models, computations of the point-mobility and of the apparent modal densities seen at several excitation points match published measurements.

The dispersion curve of the wave-guide model displays an acoustical radiation scheme which differs significantly from that of a thin homogeneous plate. It appears that piano dimensioning is such that the subsonic regime of acoustical radiation extends over a much wider frequency range than it would be for a homogeneous plate with the same low-frequency vibration. One problem in piano manufacturing is examined in relationship with the possible radiation schemes induced by the models.",360
"Vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard: Reduced models, mobility synthesis, and acoustical radiation regime",1,"The soundboard of a piano plays a vital role in the production of its distinctive sound. However, due to its complex nature, analyzing the vibroacoustics of the soundboard can be a daunting task. This research paper presents reduced models of the piano soundboard that aid in the analysis of its vibroacoustics.

The reduced models are created using the Craig-Bampton method, which enables the reduction of finite element models. The models successfully capture the frequency response of the soundboard and are able to predict its behavior in response to different boundary conditions.

To understand the mobility synthesis of the soundboard, a novel point mobility measurement method is proposed. The proposed method utilizes laser Doppler vibrometry to measure the point mobility of the soundboard. The measured point mobility data is used to synthesize the mobility of the entire soundboard. By employing this technique, it is possible to obtain a better understanding of the sound radiation behavior of the soundboard.

The acoustical radiation regime of the piano soundboard is analyzed using numerical simulations. The simulations are performed using the boundary element method, and they successfully predict the acoustical radiation behavior of the soundboard. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the boundary conditions on the radiated sound field.

In addition, the relationship between the soundboard and the piano strings is analyzed. The results show that the coupling between the soundboard and the strings plays a significant role in determining the overall sound quality of the piano.

Overall, this research paper presents a comprehensive study of the vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard. The reduced models, point mobility measurement method, numerical simulations, and analysis of the soundboard-string coupling all contribute to a better understanding of the sound production mechanism of the piano.",288
Age-Minimal Transmission for Energy Harvesting Sensors with Finite Batteries: Online Policies,0,"An energy-harvesting sensor node that is sending status updates to a destination is considered. The sensor is equipped with a battery of finite size to save its incoming energy, and consumes one unit of energy per status update transmission, which is delivered to the destination instantly over an error-free channel. The setting is online in which the harvested energy is revealed to the sensor causally over time, and the goal is to design status update transmission policy such that the long term average age of information (AoI) is minimized. AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the latest update has reached at the destination. Two energy arrival models are considered: a random battery recharge (RBR) model, and an incremental battery recharge (IBR) model. In both models, energy arrives according to a Poisson process with unit rate, with values that completely fill up the battery in the RBR model, and with values that fill up the battery incrementally, unit-by-unit, in the IBR model. The key approach to characterizing the optimal status update policy for both models is showing the optimality of renewal policies, in which the inter-update times follow a specific renewal process that depends on the energy arrival model and the battery size. It is then shown that the optimal renewal policy has an energy-dependent threshold structure, in which the sensor sends a status update only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that depends on the energy available. For both the RBR and the IBR models, the optimal energy-dependent thresholds are characterized explicitly, i.e., in closed-form, in terms of the optimal long term average AoI. It is also shown that the optimal thresholds are monotonically decreasing in the energy available in the battery, and that the smallest threshold, which comes in effect when the battery is full, is equal to the optimal long term average AoI.",318
Age-Minimal Transmission for Energy Harvesting Sensors with Finite Batteries: Online Policies,1,"This paper focuses on the problem of age-minimal transmission for energy harvesting sensors with finite batteries. In order to conserve energy and prolong the lifetime of the sensor, the focus is on developing online policies that can make intelligent decisions on when and how to transmit information. We introduce a novel online policy, called the ""age-threshold policy"", which takes a proactive approach by dynamically adjusting the transmission threshold to minimize the average age of information at the receiver. 

To do this, we first model the energy harvesting sensor system to identify the key factors that affect information transmission. We then prove theoretical bounds on the age of information under different policies, including the age-threshold policy. We develop an efficient algorithm to implement the policy and show that it outperforms existing policies in terms of minimizing the average age of information at the receiver. 

Additionally, we consider the impact of battery capacity and harvesting rate on the system performance. We show that the age-threshold policy is particularly effective when the battery capacity is small, and that the harvesting rate has a significant impact on the performance of the policy. We conclude by discussing practical considerations and future directions for research in this area.

Overall, this paper is a significant contribution to the field of energy harvesting sensors and online policy design. By developing a new age-threshold policy and providing theoretical bounds on its performance, we provide a foundation for further research on age-minimal transmission in the context of energy harvesting sensors. The results of this paper can be used to improve the performance and lifetime of energy harvesting sensor systems, enabling more efficient and effective information transmission in a variety of applications.",287
Convergence bounds for empirical nonlinear least-squares,0,"We consider best approximation problems in a nonlinear subset $\mathcal{M}$ of a Banach space of functions $(\mathcal{V},\|\bullet\|)$. The norm is assumed to be a generalization of the $L^2$-norm for which only a weighted Monte Carlo estimate $\|\bullet\|_n$ can be computed. The objective is to obtain an approximation $v\in\mathcal{M}$ of an unknown function $u \in \mathcal{V}$ by minimizing the empirical norm $\|u-v\|_n$. We consider this problem for general nonlinear subsets and establish error bounds for the empirical best approximation error. Our results are based on a restricted isometry property (RIP) which holds in probability and is independent of the nonlinear least squares setting. Several model classes are examined where analytical statements can be made about the RIP and the results are compared to existing sample complexity bounds from the literature. We find that for well-studied model classes our general bound is weaker but exhibits many of the same properties as these specialized bounds. Notably, we demonstrate the advantage of an optimal sampling density (as known for linear spaces) for sets of functions with sparse representations.",187
Convergence bounds for empirical nonlinear least-squares,1,"This paper presents new theoretical results regarding convergence bounds for empirical nonlinear least-squares (NLS) methods.

Overall, our main contribution is to establish conditions under which empirical NLS achieves the optimal rate of convergence. We use a combination of classical techniques, such as the Cramér-Rao bound, as well as new tools based on recent advances in optimization theory, to derive our results. We also discuss how our results can be applied in practical situations, such as model fitting and parameter estimation. Our work will be useful to researchers in a diverse range of fields who use NLS methods for data analysis.",152
Concurrent Constraint Conditional-Branching Timed Interactive Scores,0,"Multimedia scenarios have multimedia content and interactive events associated with computer programs. Interactive Scores (IS) is a formalism to represent such scenarios by temporal objects, temporal relations (TRs) and interactive events. IS describe TRs, but IS cannot represent TRs together with conditional branching. We propose a model for conditional branching timed IS in the Non-deterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint (ntcc) calculus. We ran a prototype of our model in Ntccrt (a real-time capable interpreter for ntcc) and the response time was acceptable for real-time interaction.

Search for top squark pair production in a final state with two tau leptons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV,0,"A search for pair production of the supersymmetric partner of the top quark, the top squark, in proton-proton collision events at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV is presented in a final state containing hadronically decaying tau leptons and large missing transverse momentum. This final state is highly sensitive to high-$\tan{\beta}$ or higgsino-like scenarios in which decays of electroweak gauginos to tau leptons are dominant. The search uses a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.2 fb$^{-1}$, which was recorded with the CMS detector during 2016 and 2017. No significant excess is observed with respect to the background prediction.

Displacement correlations in disordered athermal networks,0,"We derive exact results for correlations in the displacement fields $\{ \delta \vec{r} \} \equiv \{ \delta r_{\mu = x,y} \}$ in near-crystalline athermal systems in two dimensions. We analyze the displacement correlations produced by different types of microscopic disorder, and show that disorder at the microscopic scale gives rise to long-range correlations with a dependence on the system size $L$ given by $\langle \delta r_{\mu} \delta r_{\nu} \rangle \sim c_{\mu \nu}(r/L,\theta)$. In addition, we show that polydispersity in the constituent particle sizes and random bond disorder give rise to a logarithmic system size scaling, with $c_{\mu \nu}(\rho,\theta) \sim \text{const}_{\mu\nu} - \text{a}_{\mu\nu}(\theta)\log \rho + \text{b}_{\mu\nu}(\theta) \rho^{2} $ for $\rho~(=r/L) \to 0$. This scaling is different for the case of displacement correlations produced by random external forces at each vertex of the network, given by $c^{f}_{\mu \nu}(\rho,\theta) \sim \text{const}^{f}_{\mu \nu} -( \text{a}^{f}_{\mu \nu}(\theta) + \text{b}^{f}_{\mu \nu}(\theta) \log \rho ) \rho^2 $. Additionally, we find that correlations produced by polydispersity and the correlations produced by disorder in bond stiffness differ in their symmetry properties. Finally, we also predict the displacement correlations for a model of polydispersed soft disks subject to external pinning forces, that involve two different types of microscopic disorder. We verify our theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of polydispersed soft disks with random spring contacts in two dimensions.",258
Displacement correlations in disordered athermal networks,1,"The study investigates the displacement correlations in disordered athermal networks. Athermal networks, that is, systems without energy input, have been gaining attention as models to study jamming and rigidity transitions. Randomly rewired networks, such as the ones studied in this work, serve as diagnostic tools to understand such transitions. The authors introduce the concept of a ""displacement correlation matrix"" as a means to represent the deformation patterns of a disordered network with quenched disorder. Through numerical simulations, they quantify the range and magnitude of the displacements that are spatially correlated, and they analyze the associated eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The results indicate that the displacement correlations are mediated by geometric frustration effects, which are a hallmark of disordered systems. The authors further explore the implications of the spatial correlations on the elastic response of the network, and found that they contribute to reducing the network's effective rigidity. The findings suggest new perspectives for analyzing the response of disordered mechanical systems and could have implications for the design of materials with controlled mechanical properties. The analysis of displacement correlations provides new insights into the fascinating physics of disordered athermal networks and paves the way for future studies.",196
A 2MASS All-Sky View of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy: I. Morphology of the Sagittarius Core and Tidal Arms,0,"We present the first all-sky view of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy mapped by M giant star tracers detected in the complete Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). The main body is fit with a King profile of 30 deg limiting radius, but with a break in the density profile from stars in tidal tails. We argue that much of the observed structure beyond the 224' core radius may be unbound as the satellite undergoes catastrophic disruption. A striking, >150 deg trailing tidal tail extends from the Sgr center and arcs across the South Galactic Hemisphere. A prominent leading debris arm extends from the Sgr center northward of the Galactic plane to an ~40 kpc apoGalacticon, loops towards the North Galactic Cap (NGC) and descends back towards the Galactic plane, foreshortened and covering the NGC. The Sgr tails lie along a well-defined orbital plane that shows little precession, which supports the notion of a nearly spherical Galactic potential. The Sun lies near the path of leading Sgr debris; thus, former Sgr stars may be near or in the solar neighborhood. The number of M giants in the Sgr tails is >15% that within the King limiting radius of the Sgr center. That several gigayear old M giants are so widespread along the Sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of these arms but poses a timing problem that bears on the recent binding energy of the Sgr core and that is naturally explained by recent and catastrophic mass loss.

Sgr appears to contribute >75% of the high latitude, halo M giants; no evidence for M giant tidal debris from the Magellanic Clouds is found. Generally good correspondence is found between the M giant, all-sky map of the Sgr system and all previously published detections of potential Sgr debris with the exception of Sgr carbon stars -- which must be subluminous to resolve the discrepancy.",320
A 2MASS All-Sky View of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy: I. Morphology of the Sagittarius Core and Tidal Arms,1,"The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy is located in the important dwarf galaxy population of the Milky Way halo. It is a well-known example of a dwarf galaxy that is being tidally disrupted by the Milky Way. To improve our understanding of the morphology of the Sagittarius core and tidal arms, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of 2MASS all-sky data. 

We used color-magnitude diagram analysis to determine the distance to individual stars in the Sagittarius system and overlayed the results on top of the core and tidal structures seen in the 2MASS data. Our analysis reveals a centrally concentrated Sagittarius Core that is partially overlaid by an extended, low surface brightness Sagittarius Stream. In addition, we find that the Sagittarius Stream does not trace a symmetrical structure around the core. Instead, it exhibits strong evidence for the presence of a secondary branch in the northwest. This branch is clearly distinct from the main stream, and we consider its discovery especially significant given the ongoing debate about the Sagittarius Stream's three-dimensional structure.

We determined the range of magnitudes for Sagittarius' tip of the red giant branch and the vertical distance from the Galactic plane. We searched for and identify the most likely dwarf galaxy or globular cluster candidates embedded in the Sagittarius Stream as signposts that provide clues about the environment in which Sagittarius is being disrupted. We also discuss the implications of this analysis for the interaction between the Milky Way's halo and the Galactic Disk. Overall, the results of this study provide important new information about Sagittarius' core and tidal arms and offer a fascinating glimpse of the ongoing process of their disruption.",279
A search on the Nikiforov-Uvarov formalism,0,"An alternative treatment is proposed for the calculations carried out within the frame of Nikiforov-Uvarov method, which removes a drawback in the original theory and by pass some difficulties in solving the Schrodinger equation. The present procedure is illustrated with the example of orthogonal polynomials.

The relativistic extension of the formalism is discussed.",54
