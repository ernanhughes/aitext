      "Inserting test sample 1  Automatic synthesis of faces from visual attributes is an important problem in computer vision and has wide applications in law enforcement and entertainment. With the advent of deep generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs), attempts have been made to synthesize face images from attributes and text descriptions. In this paper, we take a different approach, where we formulate the original problem as a stage-wise learning problem. We first synthesize the facial sketch corresponding to the visual attributes and then we reconstruct the face image based on the synthesized sketch. The proposed Attribute2Sketch2Face framework, which is based on a combination of deep Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), consists of three stages: (1) Synthesis of facial sketch from attributes using a CVAE architecture, (2) Enhancement of coarse sketches to produce sharper sketches using a GAN-based framework, and (3) Synthesis of face from sketch using another GAN-based network. Extensive experiments and comparison with recent methods are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attribute-based three stage face synthesis method. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2  This paper presents an innovative method for face synthesis from visual attributes using conditional Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed system allows generating high-quality facial images by feeding the model with sketch-based visual attributes as input. Specifically, we first train a conditional VAE to learn the face representation using labeled training images. Then, we introduce a set of binary attribute vectors that specify the distinctive features and attributes of a particular face. Finally, we employ the trained generator of a GAN to synthesize new facial images, conditioned on the learned visual attributes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms other existing methods in terms of facial attribute manipulation, with the added benefit of producing more diverse and realistic outputs. Our approach enables a wide range of applications, including but not limited to, face recognition, retrieval, and virtual reality systems. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 3  We show that though conformal symmetry can be broken by the dilaton, such can happen without breaking the conformal degeneracy patterns in the spectra. We departure from R^1XS^3 slicing of AdS_5 noticing that the inverse radius, R, of S^3 relates to the temperature of the deconfinement phase transition and has to satisfy, \\hbar c/R >> \\Lambda_{QCD}. We then focus on the eigenvalue problem of the S^3 conformal Laplacian, given by 1/R^2 (K^2+1), with K^2 standing for the Casimir invariant of the so(4) algebra. Such a spectrum is characterized by a (K+1)^2 fold degeneracy of its levels, with K\\in [0,\\infty). We then break the conformal S^3 metric as, d\\tilde{s}^2=e^{-b\\chi} ((1+b^2/4) d\\chi^2 +\\sin^2\\chi (d\\theta ^2 +\\sin^2\\theta d\\varphi ^2)), and attribute the symmetry breaking scale, b\\hbar^2c^2/R^2, to the dilaton. We show that such a metric deformation is equivalent to a breaking of the conformal curvature of S^3 by a term proportional to b\\cot \\chi, and that the perturbed conformal Laplacian is equivalent to (\\tilde{K}^2 +c_K), with c_K a representation constant, and \\tilde{K}^2 being again an so(4) Casimir invariant, but this time in a representation unitarily inequivalent to the 4D rotational. In effect, the spectra before and after the symmetry breaking are determined each by eigenvalues of a Casimir invariant of an so(4) algebra, a reason for which the degeneracies remain unaltered though the conformal group symmetry breaks at the level of the representation of its algebra. We fit the S^3 radius and the \\hbar^2c^2b/R^2 scale to the high-lying excitations in the spectra of the unflavored mesons, and observe the correct tendency of the \\hbar c /R=373 MeV value to notably exceed \\Lambda_{QCD}. The size of the symmetry breaking scale is calculated as \\hbar c \\sqrt{b}/R=673.7 MeV. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

A prominent example is QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, whose conformal symmetry is well-known to be broken at low energies.\n",

Moreover, we find that this splitting depends strongly on the angular momentum of the mesons, and we provide a quantitative analysis of this dependence.\n",

      "Inserting test sample 5  This paper exhibits the closed-loop design constraints using the non-analytic function theory. First, the paper generalizes the sensitivity integral for linear feedback systems with the non-analytic sensitivity function. Sensitivity inequalities are determined by the integral relationships based on the presence of non-minimum phase zeros and right half plane poles. These inequalities are rephrased in plant parameter context, which must be satisfied by the feedback design. That indicates the ability of controllers under the influence of input disturbances and plant parameter variations. The paper then extends the integral to the analytic sensitivity function of the augmented linear feedback systems. This is useful to augment the ability of a linear feedback system to handle input disturbances and plant uncertainties, via modified sensitivity function theory. Numerical simulations are carried out to perform sensitivity analysis on three chemical control systems. That describes the usefulness and demonstrates the applicability of the result of this paper to examine and augment the ability of linear feedback system. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Furthermore, we show how these inequalities can be used to design control systems that achieve specific performance objectives, such as minimizing the effect of disturbances or maximizing disturbance rejection. The proposed methodology is illustrated through several examples, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical settings.

      "There have been regular discussions in the SE community on this issue since the 1980's, led by pioneers such as Robert Glass. As we recently passed the milestone of \"50 years of software engineering\", some recent positive efforts have been made in this direction, e.g., establishing \"industrial\" tracks in several SE conferences. However, many researchers and practitioners believe that we, as a community, are still struggling with research relevance and utility. The goal of this paper is to synthesize the evidence and experience-based opinions shared on this topic so far in the SE community, and to encourage the community to further reflect and act on the research relevance. For this purpose, we have conducted a Multi-vocal Literature Review (MLR) of 54 systematically-selected sources (papers and non peer-reviewed articles). Instead of relying on and considering the individual opinions on research relevance, mentioned in each of the sources, the MLR aims to synthesize and provide the \"holistic\" view on the topic. The highlights of our MLR findings are as follows. The top three root causes of low relevance, discussed in the community, are: (1) Researchers having simplistic views (or wrong assumptions) about SE in practice; (2) Lack of connection with industry; and (3) Wrong identification of research problems. The top three suggestions for improving research relevance are: (1) Using appropriate research approaches such as action-research; (2) Choosing relevant research problems; and (3) Collaborating with industry. By synthesizing all the discussions on this important topic so far, this paper aims to encourage further discussions and actions in the community to increase our collective efforts to improve the research relevance. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The observed region mainly along the major axis out to a radius of 8.5 kpc, and covers the strip observed with HIFI/PACS Spectrometers as part of the HERM33ES Herschel key program.

Its distribution and properties therefore play a key role in shaping the galactic environment.

A 3D spectroscopic analysis of the CO emission line was performed by applying the CLUMPFIND algorithm to the cube, in order to identify and characterize individual molecular clouds. The molecular gas is concentrated in a few giant molecular clouds (GMCs), with a total molecular gas mass of approximately 2.5 x 10^8 solar masses, and a corresponding mean H2 gas surface density of around 12 Msun/pc^2. We find that the GMCs have an approximately log-normal mass distribution and a typical mass of around 2 x 10^6 solar masses. Moreover, the molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio for M33 is found to be ~0.4, which is lower than the typical value for other galaxy types, suggesting that the molecular gas in M33 is relatively less efficiently converted into stars. Finally, we compare our results with a sample of other Local Group galaxies and find that the global molecular gas properties of M33 are broadly consistent with those of other late-type spirals, although it has somewhat lower molecular gas content at a given HI mass. The unique combination of high sensitivity, spatial resolution, and velocity resolution offered by our observations make them a valuable resource for the study of the interstellar medium and star formation in M33, and demonstrate the exquisite capabilities of current and future millimeter-wave telescopes for the study of nearby galaxies. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

If either ignition mechanism works, the two detonations can release sufficient energy to completely unbind the WD. Here we extend our 2D studies of this double-detonation model to low-mass CO WDs. We investigate the feasibility of triggering a secondary core detonation by shock convergence in low-mass CO WDs and the observable consequences of such a detonation. Our results suggest that core detonation is probable, even for the lowest CO core masses realized in nature. We compute spectra and light curves for models in which either an edge-lit or compression-triggered CO detonation is assumed to occur and compare these to models in which no CO detonation was allowed to occur. If significant shock compression of the CO WD occurs prior to detonation, explosion of the CO WD can produce a sufficiently large mass of radioactive iron-group nuclei to affect the light curves. In particular, this can lead to relatively slow post-maximum decline. If the secondary detonation is edge-lit, however, the CO WD explosion primarily yields intermediate-mass elements that affect the observables more subtly. In this case, NIR observations and detailed spectroscopic analysis would be needed to determine whether core detonation occurred.

Thus, reliable bar axial ratios can only be determined by taking into account the contributions of bulge and disc to the light distribution in the galaxy image.

      "Inserting test sample 31  The first purpose of this paper is to point out a curious result announced by Macaulay on the Hilbert function of a differential module in his famous book The Algebraic Theory of Modular Systems published in 1916.

Our aim is to explain this result in a modern language and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The importance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit symbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive.

In this paper, we investigate the nature of the truncation behavior using a combination of observational and theoretical analyses. Our results show that the disk truncation in Aquila X-1 occurs at one-third of the Eddington limit, a finding which has significant implications for our understanding of accretion physics in LMXBs. We analyze the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the system during its high state transition, finding evidence for stable accretion disk truncation and reduced disk emission. Utilizing a simple model of the accretion disk structure, we show that the observed truncation behavior can be explained through the sustained cooling of the disk.

This result provides important insight into the accretion physics of neutron star LMXBs and serves as an important stepping stone for future theoretical studies.

      "Inserting test sample 43  Introduction: Individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain show impairments in their pain-modulatory capacity. Stress-induced analgesia (SIA) is a paradigm of endogenous pain inhibition mainly tested in animals. It has not been tested in patients with chronic pain despite the important role of stress in pain modulation and the chronicity process. Methods: SIA was tested in 22 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and 18 healthy participants matched for age and gender. Pain thresholds, pain tolerance and suprathreshold pain sensitivity were examined before and after a cognitive stressor. Additionally, chronic stress levels, pain catastrophizing and pain characteristics were assessed as potential modulating factors. Results: Patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain compared to healthy controls showed significantly impaired SIA (F(1,37)=5.63, p=.02) for pain thresholds, but not pain tolerance (F(1,37)=0.05, p=.83) and stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH) to suprathreshold pain ratings (F(1,37)=7.76, p=.008). Patients (r(22)=-0.50, p=.05) but not controls (r(18)=-0.39, p=.13) with high catastrophizing had low SIA as assessed by pain thresholds. In controls suprathreshold pain ratings were significantly positively correlated with catastrophizing (r(18)=0.57, p=.03) and life-time stress exposure (r(18)=0.54, p=.03). In patients neither catastrophizing (r(22)=0.21, p=.34) nor stress exposure (r(22)=0.34, p=.34) were associated with suprathreshold SIH. Discussion: Our data suggest impairments of SIA and SIH in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Catastrophizing was associated with deficient SIA in the patients and higher pain ratings in controls. High life time stress also increased pain ratings in the controls. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

This provides an unusual situation where the dichotomic measurements (and associated hidden variables) involved in the Bell tests need only discriminate between two macroscopically distinct states of a system i.e. correspond to coarse-grained measurements that do not specify values to a level of precision of order $\\sim\\hbar$. Violations of macro-realism and macroscopic local realism are predicted. We show how one may obtain consistency with a weak form of macroscopic realism (wMR): that for a system prepared in a superposition of macroscopically distinct pointer eigenstates, the outcome of the coarse-grained pointer measurement $\\hat{M}$ is predetermined. Macroscopic realism does not however hold in a deterministic fashion, where one assumes the predetermination of outcomes prior to the unitary rotations that define the choice of measurement setting in the Bell experiment.

Deterministic macroscopic realism, on the other hand, posits that there is a definite, knowable state for all macroscopic systems at all times. We examine the philosophical and scientific underpinnings of these two viewpoints and their implications for our understanding of the physical world. We discuss the role of quantum mechanics in the debate, as well as various experimental results that have been used to support one view or the other.

This relation is traditionally calibrated in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands and relies on the empirical assumption that all Cepheids share the same intrinsic PLR shape and amplitude. However, recent studies have shown evidence of a dependency of the PLR on the metallicity and the pulsation period itself, which may introduce intrinsic scatter in the PLR. In this paper, we investigate the mid-infrared (MIR) PLR of Cepheids using the recently released, large sample of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellites. We then compare it with the NIR and visible PLRs, scrutinizing the metallicity dependence of the PLR in each band. By analyzing the PLRs of Cepheids in multi-phase, we also explore the effects of metallicity on the non-linearity of the PLR and quantify the ability of Cepheids to provide accurate distances to galaxies of different metallicities.

Finally, above $M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ all compact objects are strange quark stars. We argue that $M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ is in the range $\\sim 1.5-1.6 M_\\odot$. According to our results, the main channel for strange quark star formation in binary systems is accretion from a secondary companion on a neutron star.This opens the possibility of having explosive GRB-like phenomena not related to supernovae and not due to the merger of two neutron stars. The enhancement in the number of compact objects in the co-existence mass range $(M_\\mathrm{max}^H- \\Delta M) \\leqslant M \\leqslant M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ is not very pronounced. The number of double strange quark star's systems is rather small with only a tiny fraction which merge within a Hubble time.

In this work we designate the object, KIC 10657664, simply as KHWD3. We use the transit depth of ~0.66%, the eclipse depth of ~1.9%, and regular smooth periodic variations at the orbital frequency and twice the orbital frequency to analyze the system parameters. The smooth periodic variations are identified with the classical ellipsoidal light variation and illumination effects, and the newly utilized Doppler boosting effect. Given the measured values of R/a and inclination angle of the binary, both the ELV and DB effects are mostly sensitive to the mass ratio, q = M_2/M_1, of the binary. The two effects yield values of q which are somewhat inconsistent - presumably due to unidentified systematic effects - but which nonetheless provide a quite useful set of possibilities for the mass of the white dwarf (either 0.18 +/- 0.03 M_Sun or 0.37 +/- 0.08 M_Sun). All of the other system parameters are determined fairly robustly. In particular, we show that the white dwarf has a radius of 0.15 +/- 0.01 R_Sun which is extremely bloated over the radius it would have as a fully degenerate object, and an effective temperature T_eff = 14,100 +/- 350 K.\n",

      "Inserting test sample 97  Cosmological models that include suppression of the power spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales exhibit an exponential reduction of high-redshift, non-linear structures, including a reduction in the rate of gamma ray bursts (GRBs). Here we quantify the constraints that the detection of distant GRBs would place on structure formation models with reduced small-scale power. We compute the number of GRBs that could be detectable by the Swift satellite at high redshifts (z > 6), assuming that the GRBs trace the cosmic star formation history, which itself traces the formation of non-linear structures. We calibrate simple models of the intrinsic luminosity function of the bursts to the number and flux distribution of GRBs observed by the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE). We find that a discovery of high-z GRBs would imply strong constraints on models with reduced small-scale power. For example, a single GRB at z > 10, or 10 GRBs at z > 5, discovered by Swift during its scheduled two-year mission, would rule out an exponential suppression of the power spectrum on scales below R_c=0.09 Mpc (exemplified by warm dark matter models with a particle mass of m_x=2 keV). Models with a less sharp suppression of small-scale power, such as those with a red tilt or a running scalar index, n_s, are more difficult to constrain, because they are more degenerate with an increase in the power spectrum normalization, sigma_8, and with models in which star-formation is allowed in low-mass minihalos. We find that a tilt of \\delta n_s ~ 0.1 is difficult to detect; however, an observed rate of 1 GRB/yr at z > 12 would yield an upper limit on the running of the spectral index, alpha = d(n_s)/d(ln k) > -0.05. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this paper, we present constraints on the power spectrum using a sample of high-redshift GRBs. By analyzing the temporal and spectral properties of the GRBs, we extract information about the intervening material between the burst and the observer. We quantify the level of Lyman-alpha forest absorption, which is sensitive to the small-scale density fluctuations along the line of sight. Our analysis reveals a significant excess of power on scales smaller than 0.1 Mpc/h, with 2-sigma lower limit of 1.5 times the expected power from a linear extrapolation of the standard Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model. This excess is consistent with a damping of small-scale density fluctuations by free-streaming of neutrinos, with a combined mass of active and sterile neutrinos of about 0.2 eV. However, alternative explanations such as the contribution of axion-like particles or modified gravitational physics are not ruled out yet. We have also investigated the possible systematics effects that could mimic or alter the signal. We find no evidence of significant contamination from metal absorption or dust, but the intrinsic variability of GRBs remains an important source of uncertainty. Our constraints provide new insights on the nature of dark matter and neutrino physics, as well as the validity of the standard cosmological model on small scales. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Our new images reveal complex, well resolved filamentary substructure in the radio jets and tails. We also use these images to explore the spectral structure of 3C 31 on large and small scales. We infer the apparent magnetic field structure by correcting for Faraday rotation. Some of the intensity substructure in the jets is clearly related to structure in their apparent magnetic field: there are arcs of emission where the degree of linear polarization increases, with the apparent magnetic field parallel to the ridges of the arcs. The spectral indices are significantly steeper (0.62) within 7 arcsec of the nucleus than between 7 and 50 arcsec (0.52 - 0.57). The spectra of the jet edges are also slightly flatter than the average for their surroundings. At larger distances, the jets are clearly delimited from surrounding larger-scale emission both by their flatter radio spectra and by sharp brightness gradients. The spectral index of 0.62 in the first 7 arcsec of 3C 31's jets is very close to that found in other FR I galaxies where their jets first brighten in the radio and where X-ray synchrotron emission is most prominent. Farther from the nucleus, where the spectra flatten, X-ray emission is fainter relative to the radio. The brightest X-ray emission from FR I jets is therefore not associated with the flattest radio spectra, but with a particle-acceleration process whose characteristic energy index is 2.24.

Hence, the power consumption in networks is strongly related to the number of active network elements, such as interfaces, line cards, base chassis,...

In this paper, we consider a simplified architecture where a connection between two routers is represented as a link joining two network interfaces. When a connection is not used, both network interfaces can be turned off. Therefore, in order to reduce power consumption, the goal is to find the routing that minimizes the number of used links while satisfying all the demands.

      "Inserting test sample 123  In the present contribution, we investigate first-order nonlinear systems of partial differential equations which are constituted of two parts: a system of conservation laws and non-conservative first order terms. Whereas the theory of first-order systems of conservation laws is well established and the conditions for the existence of supplementary conservation laws, and more specifically of an entropy supplementary conservation law for smooth solutions, well known, there exists so far no general extension to obtain such supplementary conservation laws when non-conservative terms are present. We propose a framework in order to extend the existing theory and show that the presence of non-conservative terms somewhat complexifies the problem since numerous combinations of the conservative and non-conservative terms can lead to a supplementary conservation law. We then identify a restricted framework in order to design and analyze physical models of complex fluid flows by means of computer algebra and thus obtain the entire ensemble of possible combination of conservative and non-conservative terms with the objective of obtaining specifically an entropy supplementary conservation law. The theory as well as developed computer algebra tool are then applied to a Baer-Nunziato two-phase flow model and to a multicomponent plasma fluid model. The first one is a first-order fluid model, with non-conservative terms impacting on the linearly degenerate field and requires a closure since there is no way to derive interfacial quantities from averaging principles and we need guidance in order to close the pressure and velocity of the interface and the thermodynamics of the mixture. The second one involves first order terms for the heavy species coupled to second order terms for the electrons, the non-conservative terms impact the genuinely nonlinear fields and the model can be rigorously derived from kinetic theory. We show how the theory allows to recover the whole spectrum of closures obtained so far in the literature for the two-phase flow system as well as conditions when one aims at extending the thermodynamics and also applies to the plasma case, where we recover the usual entropy supplementary equation, thus assessing the effectiveness and scope of the proposed theory. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Using a perturbative method we demonstrate that the nonlinear solutions change significantly when a pure electrostatic mode is excited at the linear level instead of a mixed upper-hybrid and zero-frequency mode that is considered in a recent study. The pure electrostatic oscillations undergo phase mixing nonlinearly. However, the presence of the magnetic field significantly delays the phase-mixing compared to that observed in the corresponding unmagnetized plasma. Using 1D PIC simulations we then analyze the damping of the primary modes of the pure oscillations in detail and infer the dependence of the phase-mixing time on the magnetic field and the amplitude of the oscillations. The results are remarkably different from those found for the mixed upper-hybrid mode mentioned above. Exploiting the symmetry of the e-p plasma we then explain a generalized symmetry of our non-linear solutions. The symmetry allows us to construct a unique nonlinear solution up to the second order which does not show any signature of phase mixing but results in a nonlinear wave traveling at upper-hybrid frequency.

Interlayer excitons in heterobilayers, with layer separation of electron and hole components, feature large electric dipole that enables strong coupling with electric field and exciton-exciton interaction, at the cost that the optical dipole is substantially quenched (by several orders of magnitude).

For these n we also list the second, often the third and sometimes the fourth best packings among those that we found. In each case, the structure of the packing implies that the minimum distance d(n) between disk centers is the root of polynomial P_n with integer coefficients. In most cases we do not explicitly compute P_n but in all cases we do compute and report d(n) to 15 significant decimal digits. Disk packings in equilateral triangles differ from those in squares or circles in that for triangles there are an infinite number of values of n for which the exact value of d(n) is known, namely, when n is of the form Delta(k) := k(k+1)/2. It has also been conjectured that d(n-1) = d(n) in this case.

We describe the spatial distributions of the photospheric magnetic changes associated with this flare, including the abrupt changes in the field vector, vertical electric current and Lorentz force vector. We also trace these parameters' temporal evolution. The abrupt magnetic changes were concentrated near the neutral line and in two neighboring sunspots. Near the neutral line, the field vectors became stronger and more horizontal during the flare and the shear increased. This was due to an increase in strength of the horizontal field components near the neutral line, most significant in the horizontal component parallel to the neutral line but the perpendicular component also increased in strength. The vertical component did not show a significant, permanent overall change at the neutral line. The increase in total flux at the neutral line was accompanied by a compensating flux decrease in the surrounding volume. In the two sunspots near the neutral line the azimuthal flux abruptly decreased during the flare but this change was permanent in only one of the spots. There was a large, abrupt, downward vertical Lorentz force change during the flare, consistent with results of past analyses and recent theoretical work. The horizontal Lorentz force acted in opposite directions along each side of neutral line, with the two sunspots at each end subject to abrupt torsional forces. The shearing forces were consistent with field contraction and decrease of shear near the neutral line, whereas the field itself became more sheared as a result of the flux collapsing towards the neutral line from the surrounding volume. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Eclipses occur whenever the reflex motion of a star carries it behind the circumbinary ring; the eclipses occur with period equal to the binary orbital period of 48.4 days. Features of the light curve--including the amplitude of central reversals during mid-eclipse, the phase of eclipse with respect to the binary orbit phase, the level of brightness out-of-eclipse, the depth of eclipse, and the eclipse duty cycle--are all modulated on the timescale of nodal regression of the obscuring ring, in accord with the historical data.

Observing the bandwidth available in the network's two main components, core network, transferring the video from the servers to edge nodes close to the client, and the edge network, which is in charge of transferring the content to the user, via wireless links, we aim to find an optimal solution by exploiting the predictability of future user requests of sequential video segments, as well as the knowledge of available infrastructural resources at the core and edge wireless networks in a given future time window. Instead of regarding the bottleneck of the end-to-end connection as our throughput, we distribute the traffic load over time and use intermediate nodes between the server and the client for buffering video content to achieve higher throughput, and ultimately significantly improve the Quality of Experience for the end user in comparison with current solutions. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 144  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a popular video streaming technology that adapts the video quality to the available network conditions. However, over wireless networks, DASH suffers from quality degradation due to the inherent instability of wireless networks. In this work, we propose a novel approach that exploits network awareness to enhance DASH performance over wireless networks. Specifically, we leverage information about wireless network conditions, such as signal strength and interference, to make more informed decisions about video quality adaptation. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach in a testbed consisting of multiple mobile devices and wireless access points. Our results show that our approach significantly improves video quality and reduces stalling compared to traditional DASH. Moreover, our approach is able to provide a better user experience by adapting to network conditions in real-time. Our proposed solution can be incorporated into existing DASH systems without requiring any modifications to the video player or the server, making it easy to deploy. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 145  Classical and quantum physics impose different constraints on the joint probability distributions of observed variables in a causal structure. These differences mean that certain correlations can be certified as non-classical, which has both foundational and practical importance. Rather than working with the probability distribution itself, it can instead be convenient to work with the entropies of the observed variables. In the Bell causal structure with two inputs and outputs per party, a technique that uses entropic inequalities is known that can always identify non-classical correlations. Here we consider the analogue of this technique in the generalization of this scenario to more outcomes. We identify a family of non-classical correlations in the Bell scenario with two inputs and three outputs per party whose non-classicality cannot be detected through the direct analogue of the previous technique. We also show that use of Tsallis entropy instead of Shannon entropy does not help in this case. Furthermore, we give evidence that natural extensions of the technique also do not help. More precisely, our evidence suggests that even if we allow the observed correlations to be post-processed according to a natural class of non-classicality non-generating operations, entropic inequalities for either the Shannon or Tsallis entropies cannot detect the non-classicality, and hence that entropic inequalities are generally not sufficient to detect non-classicality in the Bell causal structure. In addition, for the bipartite Bell scenario with two inputs and three outputs we find the vertex description of the polytope of non-signalling distributions that satisfy all of the CHSH-type inequalities, which is one of the main regions of investigation in this work. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Adjacent layers meet at free interface regions, and the top layer is bounded above by a free boundary as well. A uniform gravitational field, normal to the rigid bottom, acts on the fluid. We assume that the fluid mass densities are strictly decreasing from bottom to top and consider the cases with and without surface tension acting on the free surfaces. In addition to these gravity-capillary effects, we allow a force to act on the bulk and external stress tensors to act on the free interface regions. Both of these additional forces are posited to be in traveling wave form: time-independent when viewed in a coordinate system moving at a constant, nontrivial velocity parallel to the lower rigid boundary. Without surface tension in the case of two dimensional fluids and with all positive surface tensions in the higher dimensional cases, we prove that for each sufficiently small force and stress tuple there exists a traveling wave solution.

We aim at tracing the warm gas in the disks of 5 HAeBes with gas-rich environments and physical characteristics close to those of AB Aur and HD97048, to discuss whether the detections toward these 2 objects are suggestive of peculiar conditions for the gas. We search for the H2 S(1) emission line at 17.035 \\mu\\m with VISIR, and complemented by CH molecule observations with UVES. We gather the H2 measurements from the literature to put the new results in context and search for a correlation with some disk properties. None of the 5 VISIR targets shows evidence for H2 emission. From the 3sigma upper limits on the integrated line fluxes we constrain the amount of optically thin warm gas to be less than 1.4 M_Jup in the disk surface layers. There are now 20 HAeBes observed with VISIR and TEXES instruments to search for warm H2, but only two detections (HD97048 and AB Aur) were made so far.

They may have been caused by the passage of the density wave or simply created by other means near the arms. The study of these regions may give us clues to clarifying the controversy over the existence of a triggering scenario, as proposed in the density wave theory. Using H$\\alpha$ direct imaging, we characterize the HII regions from a sample of three grand design galaxies: NGC5457, NGC628 and NGC6946. Broad band images in R and I were used to determine the position of the arms. The HII regions found to be associated with arms were selected for the study. The age and the star formation rate of these HII regions was obtained using measures on the H$\\alpha$ line. The distance between the current position of the selected HII regions and the position they would have if they had been created in the centre of the arm is calculated. A parameter, T, which measures whether a region was created in the arm or in the disc, is defined. With the help of the T parameter we determine that the majority of regions were formed some time after the passage of the density wave, with the regions located `behind the arm' (in the direction of the rotation of the galaxy) the zone they should have occupied had they been formed in the centre of the arm. The presence of the large number of regions created after the passage of the arm may be explained by the effect of the density wave, which helps to create the star-forming regions after its passage. There is clear evidence of triggering for NGC5457 and a co-rotation radius is proposed.

This is compatible with the dust mass derived from the far-infrared emission, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 with a typical clump size of 2 pc. We also show that the gas is optically thin in all lines except for $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1), CO lines are close to their thermal equilibrium condition at 17.5-20 K, the molecular hydrogen density is larger than critical and HCN and HCO+ lines have a subthermal excitation temperature of 9 K with a density smaller than critical. The average $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO line ratio is high (~21), and close to the $^{12}$CO/C$^{18}$O ratio (~30) that was measured in the north-western region and estimated in the south-east stacking. The fact that the optically thin $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines have comparable intensities means that the secondary element $^{13}$C is depleted with respect to the primary $^{12}$C, as is expected just after a recent star formation.

(2) The history of DLA evolution reflects primarily the evolution of the underlying cosmic density, galaxy size and galaxy interactions. With higher density and more interactions at high redshift DLAs are larger in both absolute terms and in relative terms with respect to virial radii of halos. (3) The variety of DLAs at high redshift is richer with a large contribution coming from galactic filaments, created through close galaxy interactions. The portion of gaseous disks of galaxies where most stars reside makes relatively small contribution to DLA incidence at z=3-4. (4) The vast majority of DLAs arise in halos of mass M_h=10^10-10^12 Msun at z=1.6-4. At z=3-4, 20-30% of DLA hosts are Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs).\n",

We have taken high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of PG1159-035 with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer. They are analysed with non-LTE line blanketed model atmospheres. We confirm the high effective temperature with high precision (Teff=140,000+/-5000 K) and the surface gravity of logg=7. For the first time we assess the abundances of silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and iron. Silicon is about solar. For phosphorus we find an upper limit of solar abundance. A surprisingly strong depletion of sulfur (2% solar) is discovered. Iron is not detected, suggesting an upper limit of 30% solar. This coincides with the Fe deficiency found in other PG1159 stars. We redetermine the nitrogen abundance and find it to be lower by one dex compared to previous analyses. The sulfur depletion is in contradiction with current models of AGB star intershell nucleosynthesis. The iron deficiency confirms similar results for other PG1159 stars and is explained by the conversion of iron into heavier elements by n-capture in the s-processing environment of the precursor AGB star. However, the extent of the iron depletion is stronger than predicted by evolutionary models.

They rule out a fast wide-angle wind, and tentatively favor a magneto-centrifugal disk wind launched out to 0.6 AU. We aim to assess the SiO content at the base of the HH212 jet to set an independent constraint on the location of the jet launch zone with respect to the dust sublimation radius. We present the first sub-arcsecond (0\"44x0\"96) CO map of the HH212 jet base, obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. Combining this with previous SiO(5-4) data, we infer the CO(2-1) opacity and mass-flux in the high-velocity jet and arrive at a much tighter lower limit to the SiO abundance than possible from the (optically thick) SiO emission alone. Gas-phase SiO at high velocity contains at least 10% of the elemental silicon if the jet is dusty, and at least 40% if the jet is dust-free, if CO and SiO have similar excitation temperatures. Such a high SiO content is challenging for current chemical models of both dust-free winds and dusty interstellar shocks.

This excess of SiO is concentrated in the high-velocity jet spine, suggesting that SiO is preferentially ejected along the jet axis. Furthermore, the high SiO abundance appears to be correlated with other molecular tracers such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methanol (CH3OH), suggesting a possible connection between these molecules and the SiO enhancement mechanism. We propose that the high SiO abundance in the HH212 jet may result from the interaction between the jet material and the surrounding envelope, which could trigger chemical processes leading to SiO formation.

Thus,increased depth and enhanced stellar as well as HI density near the optical center suggests that the SMC may have a bulge. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 253  This is the first of three papers that develop structures which are counted by a \"parabolic\" generalization of Catalan numbers. Fix a subset R of {1,..,n-1}. Consider the ordered partitions of {1,..,n} whose block sizes are determined by R. These are the \"inverses\" of (parabolic) multipermutations whose multiplicities are determined by R. The standard forms of the ordered partitions are refered to as \"R-permutations\". The notion of 312-avoidance is extended from permutations to R-permutations. Let lambda be a partition of N such that the set of column lengths in its shape is R or R union {n}. Fix an R-permutation pi. The type A Demazure character (key polynomial) in x_1, .., x_n that is indexed by lambda and pi can be described as the sum of the weight monomials for some of the semistandard Young tableau of shape lambda that are used to describe the Schur function indexed by lambda. Descriptions of these \"Demazure\" tableaux developed by the authors in earlier papers are used to prove that the set of these tableaux is convex in Z^N if and only if pi is R-312-avoiding if and only if the tableau set is the entire principal ideal generated by the key of pi. These papers were inspired by results of Reiner and Shimozono and by Postnikov and Stanley concerning coincidences between Demazure characters and flagged Schur functions. This convexity result is used in the next paper to deepen those results from the level of polynomials to the level of tableau sets. The R-parabolic Catalan number is defined to be the number of R-312-avoiding permutations.

      "Inserting test sample 259  L1157-B1 is the brightest shocked region of the large-scale molecular outflow, considered the prototype of chemically rich outflows, being the ideal laboratory to study how shocks affect the molecular gas. Several deuterated molecules have been previously detected with the IRAM 30m, most of them formed on grain mantles and then released into the gas phase due to the shock. We aim to observationally investigate the role of the different chemical processes at work that lead to formation the of DCN and test the predictions of the chemical models for its formation. We performed high-angular resolution observations with NOEMA of the DCN(2-1) and H13CN(2-1) lines to compute the deuterated fraction, Dfrac(HCN). We detected emission of DCN(2-1) and H13CN(2-1) arising from L1157-B1 shock. Dfrac(HCN) is ~4x10$^{-3}$ and given the uncertainties, we did not find significant variations across the bow-shock. Contrary to HDCO, whose emission delineates the region of impact between the jet and the ambient material, DCN is more widespread and not limited to the impact region. This is consistent with the idea that gas-phase chemistry is playing a major role in the deuteration of HCN in the head of the bow-shock, where HDCO is undetected as it is a product of grain-surface chemistry. The spectra of DCN and H13CN match the spectral signature of the outflow cavity walls, suggesting that their emission result from shocked gas. The analysis of the time dependent gas-grain chemical model UCL-CHEM coupled with a C-type shock model shows that the observed Dfrac(HCN) is reached during the post-shock phase, matching the dynamical timescale of the shock. Our results indicate that the presence of DCN in L1157-B1 is a combination of gas-phase chemistry that produces the widespread DCN emission, dominating in the head of the bow-shock, and sputtering from grain mantles toward the jet impact region. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The high-angular resolution images reveal that DCN is primarily associated with the jet-like outflow rather than the quiescent gas surrounding the outflow. Based on the comparison with other molecular tracers, our chemical modelling suggests that DCN traces the shocked gas in the outflow, whereas DCO+ and N2D+ mainly trace the quiescent gas. The shock chemical model suggests that the fractional abundance of DCN increases toward the shock front and peaks at a radius of ~10^16 cm from the central source. The observed DCN emission can be reproduced with a shock model that includes a pre-shock density enhancement, suggesting that the L1157-B1 outflow is likely propagating into a medium previously enriched in deuterium. Our observations and modelling highlight the power of DCN as a shock tracer in jet-like molecular outflows. They also provide important constraints on the shock conditions in the L1157-B1 outflow, and suggest that this outflow is an excellent laboratory to study deuterium chemistry and the formation of deuterated molecules in star-forming regions. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 261  Over the last few years there has been much interest in the production of hard X-rays from various targets using a kHz short pulse laser at intensities above 1014Wcm-2 (A). Most of these studies have been carried out in vacuum and very many fewer studies have been carried out in air. Recently this lack has been partially addressed with the development of femtosecond laser micromachining. Another similar although apparently unconnected field (B) deals with the channelling of high power laser beam in filaments after passage through long distances in air. This has been largely driven by the construction of a mobile terawatt laser beam (Teramobile) for atmospheric studies. The laser beams in these two cases (A and B) have very different pulse energies (mJ against J) although the filaments in (B) have similar energies to (A) and are clamped at intensities less than 1014 Wcm-2. This paper has been written to compare the production of hard X-rays in these two cases. The conclusion is interesting that a focused sub TW laser pulse in air reaches intensities sufficiently high that characteristic K and L X-rays are generated from a number of metal and non metal targets as well as a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum. On the other hand the clamping of the multi-filaments in a 100 TW laser beam in air cannot generate hard Xrays especially when propagated over long distances. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The experimental setup involved the use of a Nd:YLF laser with a pulse of up to 10 J and 10 ns at a 1-kHz repetition rate for the kHz laser, while a double-clad fiber laser generating 120 W at 1.07μm with ~500μm core diameter was used as the high power multifilament laser beam source. Four different target materials, including copper, aluminum, silver, and gold were used for this study. Our results show that the high power multifilament laser beam produced more photons compared to the kHz laser from all the tested targets. The photon flux for silver was the highest for both methods. We observed that the photon production using the high power multifilament laser beam is more homogeneous than the kHz laser.

      "Inserting test sample 263  In this work we investigate the impact of calculating non-equilibrium chemical abundances consistently with the temperature structure for the atmospheres of highly-irradiated, close-in gas giant exoplanets. Chemical kinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the chemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be driven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and photochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature (P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the chemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite the fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated chemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with non-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and photochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical disequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T profile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical equilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences for the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission spectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics calculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium chemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated observations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong interpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models violating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Our results reveal significant differences in the PT profiles of the models using consistent chemical kinetics compared to those using a simplified scheme. These differences are strongly dependent on the metallicity and C/O ratio of the atmosphere. Moreover, we find that changes in the chemical composition lead to considerable variations in the emission spectra of hot Jupiters, including significant differences in prominent molecular absorption features. We show that the H2O abundance in the atmosphere significantly affects the PT profile and alters the emission spectra. We find that the contribution of minor species like NH3, HCN, and CO2 also needs to be considered for characterizing the chemical composition of hot Jupiter atmospheres.

However, adding these fields by hand is not very satisfactory as it does not address the big questions like a possible embedding into a unified gauge theory.

The existing accounts typically deal with this issue by providing estimates on the relevant couplings. In this letter we consider a complete model based on the $SU(4)_{\\rm C}\\otimes SU(2)_{\\rm L}\\otimes U(1)_{\\rm R}$ gauge symmetry, a subgroup of $SO(10)$, featuring both scalar and vector leptoquarks.

      "Inserting test sample 277  We analyze and model an M8.0 flare on 2005 May 13 observed by TRACE and RHESSI to determine the energy release rate from magnetic reconnection that forms and heats numerous flare loops. The flare exhibits two ribbons in UV 1600 {\\AA} emission. Analysis shows that the UV light curve at each flaring pixel rises impulsively within a few minutes, and decays slowly with a timescale >10 min. Since the lower atmosphere (transition region and chromosphere) responds to energy deposit nearly instantaneously, the rapid UV brightening is thought to reflect the energy release process in the newly formed flare loop rooted at the footpoint. We utilize spatially resolved (down to 1 arcsec) UV light curves and thick-target hard X-ray emission to construct heating functions of a few thousand flare loops anchored at UV foot points, and compute plasma evolution in these loops using the EBTEL model. The modeled coronal temperatures and densities of these flare loops are used to calculate synthetic soft X-ray spectra and light curves, which compare favorably with those observed by RHESSI and GOES/XRS. The time-dependent transition region DEM for each loop during its decay phase is also computed with a simplified model and used to calculate the optically-thin C IV line emission, which dominates the UV 1600 {\\AA} bandpass during the flare.

A continuous corner film is connected to the bulk liquid, while a discontinuous one is not. To disclose their effects on evaporation in porous media, a pore network model with both continuous and discontinuous corner films is developed, which considers the capillary and viscous forces as well as the effects of corner films on the threshold pressures of pores. The capillary valve effect induced by the sudden geometrical expansion between the small and large pores is also taken into account in the model. The developed pore network model agrees well with the evaporation experiment with a quasi 2D micro model porous medium, in terms of not only the variation of the liquid saturation in each pore but also the variation of the total evaporation rate. The pore network models that neglect the corner films or the liquid viscosity are also compared with the experiment so as to shed light on the roles of the corner films. The continuous corner films, which contribute to sustain the high evaporation rate, can be interrupted to be the discontinuous ones not only by the gas invasion into pores but also by the capillary scissors effect due to the local convex topology of the solid matrix. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

After the current accomplishment of the high accuracies of CMB measurements, accompanying precision cosmology from LSS data is emphasized. We investigate the dynamical dark energy models which can produce the same CMB angular power spectra as that of the LCDM model with less than a sub-percent level accuracy. If one adopts the dynamical DE models using the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, w = w0 + wa(1-a), then one obtains models (w0,wa)= (-0.8,-0.767), (-0.9,-0.375), (-1.1,0.355), (-1.2,0.688) named as M8, M9, M11, and M12, respectively.

The difference of f between M8 (M9, M11, M12) and the LCDM model becomes maximum at z ~ 0.25 with -2.4 (-1.2, 1.2, 2.5)%. This is a scale-independent quantity.

The model can be utilized to predict macroscopic properties of wall-turbulence such as transition, friction drag reduction, and heat transfer under various flow conditions. The model also provides a better understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of turbulence in wall-bounded flows. The model is verified against a range of experimental and numerical datasets. The results show that the model accurately captures the key features of wall-turbulence in various flows, including the power-law scaling and spectral characteristics.

Each primary needs to select a price and a set of non-interfering locations (which is an independent set in the conflict graph of the region) at which to offer its channel without knowing the transmission qualities of the channels of its competitors. We formulate the above problem as a non-cooperative game. We consider two scenarios-i) when the region is small, ii) when the region is large. In the first setting, we focus on a class of conflict graphs, known as mean valid graphs which commonly arise when the region is small. We explicitly compute a symmetric Nash equilibrium (NE); the NE is threshold type in that primaries only choose independent set whose cardinality is greater than a certain threshold. The threshold on the cardinality increases with increase in quality of the channel on sale. We show that the symmetric NE strategy profile is unique in a special class of conflict graphs (linear graph). In the second setting, we consider node symmetric conflict graphs which arises when the number of locations is large (potentially, infinite). We explicitly compute a symmetric NE that randomizes equally among the maximum independent sets at a given channel state vector.

      "Inserting test sample 301  The exclusive omega electroproduction off the proton was studied in a large kinematical domain above the nucleon resonance region and for the highest possible photon virtuality (Q2) with the 5.75 GeV beam at CEBAF and the CLAS spectrometer. Cross sections were measured up to large values of the four-momentum transfer (-t < 2.7 GeV2) to the proton. The contributions of the interference terms sigma_TT and sigma_TL to the cross sections, as well as an analysis of the omega spin density matrix, indicate that helicity is not conserved in this process. The t-channel pi0 exchange, or more generally the exchange of the associated Regge trajectory, seems to dominate the reaction gamma* p -> omega p, even for Q2 as large as 5 GeV2. Contributions of handbag diagrams, related to Generalized Parton Distributions in the nucleon, are therefore difficult to extract for this process. Remarkably, the high-t behaviour of the cross sections is nearly Q2-independent, which may be interpreted as a coupling of the photon to a point-like object in this kinematical limit. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this paper, we present a theoretical and experimental investigation of the DVCS of omega mesons using electromagnetic probes. Our analysis employs a combination of phenomenological models and QCD calculations, which allows us to study the sensitivity of the DVCS cross-sections to the different GPD parametrizations.

Dov\\v{c}iak & Done (2016) proposed a method based on calculations assuming a point-like lamp-post corona. To perform more self-consistent calculations of energy spectra of extended coronae, we develop monk, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code dedicated to calculations of Comptonised spectra in the Kerr spacetime. In monk we assume Klein-Nishina scattering cross section and include all general relativistic effects. We find that for a corona located above the disc, the spectrum is not isotropic, but with harder and less luminous spectra towards observers at lower inclinations, owing to anisotropic illumination of the seed photons. This anisotropy also leads to an underestimated size of the corona if we assume the corona to be a point-like, isotropic source located on the black hole rotation axis, demonstrating the necessity of more self-consistent calculations. We also inspect the effect of motion and geometry of the corona on the emergent spectrum. Finally, we discuss the implication of anisotropic corona emission for the reflection spectrum in AGNs as well as black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs).

The size of the corona is an important parameter to understand the underlying physics of coronal heating as well as the dynamics of magnetic reconnection. Despite its importance, the size of the corona is difficult to measure directly due to its tenuous nature. In this study, we used the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to simulate the emission spectra of extended coronae. We then compared these simulations to observational data to derive constraints on the size of the corona.

Our model fit includes up to four components (bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes into account disk breaks. We find that ignoring the disk break and using a single disk scale length in the model fit for Type II (down-bending) disk galaxies can lead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. We find that for galaxies with B/T $\\geq$ 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, $r_{\\rm br}/R_{\\rm bar}$, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of B/T the ratio remains roughly constant. This suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies the disk break is likely related to the outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar, and thus moves outwards as the bar grows. For galaxies with small bulges, B/T $<$ 0.1, $r_{\\rm br}/R_{\\rm bar}$ spans a wide range from 1 to 6. This suggests that the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be different from that in galaxies with more massive bulges.

Using the general relativistic Shapiro delay, the masses of the WD and pulsar components were previously found to be $0.28\\pm 0.03 M_{\\odot}$ and $1.3\\pm 0.2 M_{\\odot}$ (68% confidence), respectively. Standard binary evolution theory suggests that PSR J1713+0747 evolved from a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Here, we test this hypothesis. We used a binary evolution code and a WD evolution code to calculate evolutionary sequences of LMXBs that could result in binary millisecond radio pulsars such as PSR J1713+0747. During the mass exchange, the mass transfer is nonconservative. Because of the thermal and viscous instabilities developing in the accretion disk, the neutron star accretes only a small part of the incoming material.

The progenitor star was likely a low-mass main-sequence star with a mass around 1.3 solar masses and an age of about 2 billion years.

In all five observations the afterglow is clearly detected. The last Chandra pointing was performed on 2008-May-04, 642 days after the burst - the latest detection of a GRB X-ray afterglow ever. A reanalysis of the Swift XRT light curve together with the three detections by Chandra in 2007 reveals a break at about 1.0 Ms after the burst with a slight steepening of the decay slope from alpha = 1.32 to 1.61. This break coincides with a significant hardening of the X-ray spectrum, consistent with a cooling break in the wind medium scenario, in which the cooling frequency of the afterglow crosses the X-ray band. The last two Chandra observations in 2007 December and 2008 May provide evidence for another break at about one year after the burst. If interpreted as a jet break, this late-time break implies a jet half opening angle of about 14 degrees for a wind medium.

Finding such a coloring generalizes several other well-known problems of vertex-distinguishing colorings in graphs.We show that for any graph (without connected component reduced to an edge or a single vertex), the minimum number of colors for which such a coloring exists can only take 3possible values depending on the order of the graph.

      "Inserting test sample 335  We propose that the intensity changes and spectral evolution along the M87 jet can be explained by adiabatic changes to the particle momentum distribution function and the magnetic field. This is supported by the lack of any significant variation in the radio-to-optical spectral index along the jet and the moderate changes in radio brightness. Assuming a simple scaling law between magnetic field and density, we use the deprojection of a 2 cm VLA intensity map by Sparks, Biretta, & Macchetto (1996) to predict the spectral evolution along the jet. We derive limits for the magnetic field and the total pressure by comparing our results with the spatially resolved fit to spectral data by Neumann, Meisenheimer, & Roeser (1997) of a model spectrum that cuts off at approx 10^15 Hz. To explain the weakness of synchrotron cooling along the jet, the magnetic field strength must lie below the equipartition value. Although the inferred pressure in the limit of nonrelativistic bulk flow lies far above the estimated pressure of the interstellar matter in the center of M87, bulk Lorentz factors Gamma_jet in the range of 3 - 5 and inclination angles approx less than 25 deg lead to pressure estimates close to the ISM pressure. The average best fit magnetic fields we derive fall in the range of 20 - 40 microG, departing from equipartition by a factor approx 1.5 - 5. This model is consistent with the proposal by Bicknell & Begelman (1996) that the knots in the M87 jet are weak, oblique shocks.

      "Several parametric spacetimes which deviate from the Kerr metric have been proposed in order to test this theorem with observations of black holes in both the electromagnetic and gravitational-wave spectra. Such metrics often contain naked singularities or closed timelike curves in the vicinity of the compact objects that can limit the applicability of the metrics to compact objects that do not spin rapidly, and generally admit only two constants of motion. The existence of a third constant, however, can facilitate the calculation of observables, because the equations of motion can be written in first-order form. In this paper, I design a Kerr-like black hole metric which is regular everywhere outside of the event horizon, possesses three independent constants of motion, and depends nonlinearly on four free functions that parameterize potential deviations from the Kerr metric. This metric is generally not a solution to the field equations of any particular gravity theory, but can be mapped to known four-dimensional black hole solutions of modified theories of gravity for suitable choices of the deviation functions. I derive expressions for the energy, angular momentum, and epicyclic frequencies of a particle on a circular equatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the location of the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, I write the metric in a Kerr-Schild-like form, which allows for a straightforward implementation of fully relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows in this metric.

      "Inserting test sample 349  We study radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) using a digital radio transmitter for applications where alternative analog transmit circuits are impractical. An important paramter for assessing the viability of an RF WPT system is its end-to-end efficiency. In this regard, we present a prototype test-bed comprising a software-defined radio (SDR) transmitter and an energy harvesting receiver with a low resistive load; employing an SDR makes our research meaningful for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We analyze the effect of clipping and non-linear amplification at the SDR on multisine waveforms. Our experiments suggest that when the DC input power at the transmitter is constant, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) multisine are unsuitable for RF WPT over a flat-fading channel, due to their low average radiated power. The results indicate that the end-to-end efficiency is positively correlated to the average RF power of the waveform, and that it reduces with increasing PAPR. Consequently, digital modulations such as phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modeulation (QAM) yield better end-to-end efficiency than multisines. Moreover, the end-to-end efficiency of PSK and QAM signals is invariant of the transmission bit rate. An in-depth analysis of the end-to-end efficiency of WPT reveals that the transmitter efficiency is lower than the receiver efficiency. Furthermore, we study the impact of a reflecting surface on the end-to-end efficiency of WPT, and assess the transmission quality of the information signals by evaluating their error vector magnitude (EVM) for SWIPT.

      "Inserting test sample 357  This paper presents a novel approach for multi-task learning of language understanding (LU) and dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue systems. Multi-task training enables the sharing of the neural network layers responsible for encoding the user utterance for both LU and DST and improves performance while reducing the number of network parameters. In our proposed framework, DST operates on a set of candidate values for each slot that has been mentioned so far. These candidate sets are generated using LU slot annotations for the current user utterance, dialogue acts corresponding to the preceding system utterance and the dialogue state estimated for the previous turn, enabling DST to handle slots with a large or unbounded set of possible values and deal with slot values not seen during training. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between training and inference, we investigate the use of scheduled sampling on LU output for the current user utterance as well as the DST output for the preceding turn. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

By subtracting the mean abundances of $s$-poor from $s$-rich stars, we derive $s$-process residuals or empirical $s$-process distributions for M4 and M22. We find that the $s$-process distribution in M22 is more weighted toward the heavy $s$-peak (Ba, La, Ce) and Pb than M4, which has been enriched mostly with light $s$-peak elements (Sr, Y, Zr). We construct simple chemical evolution models using yields from massive star models that include rotation, which dramatically increases $s$-process production at low metallicity. We show that our massive star models with rotation rates of up to 50\\% of the critical (break-up) velocity and changes to the preferred $^{17}$O($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne rate produce insufficient heavy $s$-elements and Pb to match the empirical distributions. For models that incorporate AGB yields, we find that intermediate-mass yields (with a $^{22}$Ne neutron source) alone do not reproduce the light-to-heavy $s$-element ratios for M4 and M22, and that a small contribution from models with a $^{13}$C pocket is required. With our assumption that $^{13}$C pockets form for initial masses below a transition range between 3.0 and 3.5 M$_\\odot$, we match the light-to-heavy s-element ratio in the s-process residual of M22 and predict a minimum enrichment timescale of between 240 and 360 Myr.

      "Inserting test sample 361  The severity of knee osteoarthritis is graded using the 5-point Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) scale where healthy knees are assigned grade 0, and the subsequent grades 1-4 represent increasing severity of the affliction. Although several methods have been proposed in recent years to develop models that can automatically predict the KL grade from a given radiograph, most models have been developed and evaluated on datasets not sourced from India. These models fail to perform well on the radiographs of Indian patients. In this paper, we propose a novel method using convolutional neural networks to automatically grade knee radiographs on the KL scale. Our method works in two connected stages: in the first stage, an object detection model segments individual knees from the rest of the image; in the second stage, a regression model automatically grades each knee separately on the KL scale. We train our model using the publicly available Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset and demonstrate that fine-tuning the model before evaluating it on a dataset from a private hospital significantly improves the mean absolute error from 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03-1.15) to 0.28 (95% CI: 0.25-0.32).

The KL scale is a widely used method for grading knee OA, which ranges from 0 (normal joint space) to 4 (severe joint space narrowing with bone deformity). However, manual grading of KL score is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. CNNs have shown promise in the medical field for automated image analysis tasks, and this study aims to evaluate their effectiveness in grading knee OA on the KL scale. Using a dataset of 376 knee radiographs, a CNN model was trained and tested. The results show that the proposed CNN-based approach achieved an accuracy of 86.7% in classifying KL grades, outperforming a traditional machine learning approach.

Only a handful of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae have been observed in X-rays, and until recently GW Lib was the only binary of this type with complete coverage of an X-ray light curve throughout a superoutburst. We collected extensive X-ray data of a second such system to understand the extent to which the unexpected properties of GW Lib are common to the WZ Sge class. We analysed the X-ray light curve and compared it with the behaviour of superhumps which were detected in the optical light curve. We also performed spectral analysis of the data. The results were compared with the properties of GW Lib, for which new X-ray observations were also obtained. SSS122222 was variable and around five times brighter in 0.3-10 keV X-rays during the superoutburst than in quiescence, mainly because of a significant strengthening of a high-energy component of the X-ray spectrum. The post-outburst decline of the X-ray flux lasted at least 500 d. The data show no evidence of the expected optically thick boundary layer in the system during the outburst. SSS122222 also exhibited a sudden X-ray flux change in the middle of the superoutburst, which occurred exactly at the time of the superhump stage transition. A similar X-ray behaviour was also detected in GW Lib. This result demonstrates a relationship between the outer disc and the white dwarf boundary layer for the first time, and suggests that models for accretion discs in high mass ratio accreting binaries are currently incomplete. The very long decline to X-ray quiescence is also in strong contrast to the expectation of low viscosity in the disc after outburst. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Agents differ with regard to their profession, family status and age and interact with other agents at home, work or during leisure activities. The model allows to implement and test actually used or counterfactual policies such as closing schools or the leisure industry explicitly in the model in order to explore their impact on the spread of the virus, and their economic consequences. The model is calibrated with German statistical data on time use, demography, households, firm demography, employment, company profits and wages. I set up a baseline scenario based on the German containment policies and fit the epidemiological parameters of the simulation to the observed German death curve and an estimated infection curve of the first COVID-19 wave. My model suggests that by acting one week later, the death toll of the first wave in Germany would have been 180% higher, whereas it would have been 60% lower, if the policies had been enacted a week earlier. I finally discuss two stylized fiscal policy scenarios: procyclical (zero-deficit) and anticyclical fiscal policy. In the zero-deficit scenario a vicious circle emerges, in which the economic recession spreads from the high-interaction leisure industry to the rest of the economy. Even after eliminating the virus and lifting the restrictions, the economic recovery is incomplete. Anticyclical fiscal policy on the other hand limits the economic losses and allows for a V-shaped recovery, but does not increase the number of deaths. These results suggest that an optimal response to the pandemic aiming at containment or holding out for a vaccine combines early introduction of containment measures to keep the number of infected low with expansionary fiscal policy to keep output in lower risk sectors high. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 377  A discrete time stochastic model for a multiagent system given in terms of a large collection of interacting Markov chains is studied. The evolution of the interacting particles is described through a time inhomogeneous transition probability kernel that depends on the 'gradient' of the potential field. The particles, in turn, dynamically modify the potential field through their cumulative input. Interacting Markov processes of the above form have been suggested as models for active biological transport in response to external stimulus such as a chemical gradient. One of the basic mathematical challenges is to develop a general theory of stability for such interacting Markovian systems and for the corresponding nonlinear Markov processes that arise in the large agent limit. Such a theory would be key to a mathematical understanding of the interactive structure formation that results from the complex feedback between the agents and the potential field. It will also be a crucial ingredient in developing simulation schemes that are faithful to the underlying model over long periods of time. The goal of this work is to study qualitative properties of the above stochastic system as the number of particles (N) and the time parameter (n) approach infinity. In this regard asymptotic properties of a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system, that arises in the propagation of chaos limit of the stochastic model, play a key role. We show that under suitable conditions this dynamical system has a unique fixed point. This result allows us to study stability properties of the underlying stochastic model. We show that as N \\rightarrow \\infty, the stochastic system is well approximated by the dynamical system, uniformly over time. As a consequence, for an arbitrarily initialized system, as N\\rightarrow \\infty and n \\rightarrow \\infty, the potential field and the empirical measure of the interacting particles are shown to converge to the unique fixed point of the dynamical system. In general, simulation of such interacting Markovian systems is a computationally daunting task.

      "Introduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide range of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers, stability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998), which is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable attention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the coalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the process before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the hydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when the drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \\& Davis 1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops relaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation of the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \\& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev \\& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of two sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a preliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case of hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the expense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath figures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995).

      "In general, coalescence refers to the process whereby two or more drops combine to form a single drop. Sessile drops, in particular, are drops that are stationary on a surface, as opposed to sliding or rolling. The coalescence of sessile drops occurs when two or more such drops come into contact on a surface, and the forces acting on the drops cause them to merge.\n",

      "The factors influencing the coalescence of sessile drops are complex and dependent on a range of parameters, including surface topography, intermolecular forces, and drop size. A key parameter is the contact angle, which is the angle between the drop and the surface it is resting on. The contact angle is determined by the relative magnitudes of the various forces acting on the drop, including cohesion, adhesion, and gravitational forces.\n",

The total accumulated mass by ~10 clusters is about 1.5x10^7 Solar masses. Each cluster is disrupted by the SMBH at a distance of roughly one parsec. The density profile that results after the final inspiral event is characterized by a core of roughly this radius, and an envelope with density that falls off as 1/r^2. These properties are similar to those of the MW NSC, with the exception of the core size, which in the MW is a little smaller. But by continuing the evolution of the model after the final inspiral event, we find that the core shrinks substantially via gravitational encounters in a time (when scaled to the MW) of 10 Gyr as the stellar distribution evolves toward a Bahcall-Wolf cusp. We also show that the luminosity function of the MW NSC is consistent with the hypothesis that a large fraction of the mass comes from (~10Gyr) old stars, brought in by globular clusters.

In this paper, we present an analysis of NGC7089 (M2) using this survey. We find that this cluster is composed of seven distinct stellar populations, each with unique characteristics. These populations can be differentiated based on their magnesium and calcium content, as well as their position on the horizontal branch. Our analysis suggests that NGC7089 (M2) has a complex star formation history, with multiple episodes of star formation occurring over a period of billions of years. The properties of these different populations provide insight into the formation and evolution of globular clusters, and may help to shed light on the early formation of our galaxy.

Direct measurement of stellar angular diameters is difficult: at interstellar distances stars are generally too small to resolve by any individual imaging telescope. This fundamental limitation can be overcome by studying the diffraction pattern in the shadow cast when an asteroid occults a star, but only when the photometric uncertainty is smaller than the noise added by atmospheric scintillation. Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes used for particle astrophysics observations have not generally been exploited for optical astronomy due to the modest optical quality of the mirror surface.\n",

The technique of differential tacking was used, where the stars were tracked simultaneously with a nearby reference star. Observed images of the stars were then precisely analyzed for changes in shape due to their apparent size. The angular diameters measured range from 0.24 to 0.74 milliarcseconds - the smallest diameters ever measured directly. The results are consistent with previous estimates for three of the stars, yet for two stars, the measured diameters are smaller than previous estimates. The observations demonstrate the power of the Cherenkov technique for making accurate, sub-milliarcsecond measurements of stellar angular sizes, and support the use of Cherenkov telescopes in future astronomical studies. Potential applications include the investigation of the structure and composition of stars, as well as the evaluation of current models of stellar evolution.

Such an enhancement in $\\alpha$ has recently been observed in simulations of turbulent transport driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) when convection is present, without requiring a net magnetic flux. We independently recover this result by carrying out PLUTO MHD simulations of vertically stratified, radiative, shearing boxes with the thermodynamics and opacities appropriate to DN. The results are robust against the choice of vertical boundary conditions. The thermal equilibrium solutions found by the simulations trace the well-known S-curve in the density-temperature plane. We confirm that the high values of \\alpha ~ 0.1 occur near the tip of the hot branch of the S-curve, where convection is active. However, we also present thermally-stable simulations at lower temperatures that have standard values of \\alpha ~ 0.03 despite the presence of vigorous convection.

We study the complexity of estimating the ground energy of a fixed, translationally invariant Hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit, to within a given precision; the number of bits $n$ for the precision is the sole input to the problem. The complexity of this problem captures how difficult it is for the physicist to measure or compute another digit in the approximation of a physical quantity in the thermodynamic limit.

Initial modelling of the system by Abbott et al. (2016a) supposes that the formation of black holes with such large masses from the evolution of single massive stars is only feasible if the wind mass-loss rates of the progenitors were greatly reduced relative to the mass-loss rates of massive stars in the Galaxy, concluding that heavy BHs must form in low-metallicity (Z < 0.25-0.5 Zsun) environments. However, strong surface magnetic fields also provide a powerful mechanism for modifying mass loss and rotation of massive stars, independent of environmental metallicity (ud-Doula & Owocki 2002; ud-Doula et al. 2008). In this paper we explore the hypothesis that some heavy BHs, with masses >25 Msun such as those inferred to compose GW150914, could be the natural end-point of evolution of magnetic massive stars in a solar-metallicity environment. Using the MESA code, we developed a new grid of single, non-rotating, solar metallicity evolutionary models for initial ZAMS masses from 40-80 Msun that include, for the first time, the quenching of the mass loss due to a realistic dipolar surface magnetic field. The new models predict TAMS masses that are significantly greater than those from equivalent non-magnetic models, reducing the total mass lost by a strongly magnetized 80 Msun star during its main sequence evolution by 20 Msun.

      "Inserting test sample 427  We describe the long-term dynamics of sustained stratified shear flows in the laboratory. The Stratified Inclined Duct (SID) experiment sets up a two-layer exchange flow in an inclined duct connecting two reservoirs containing salt solutions of different densities. This flow is primarily characterised by two non-dimensional parameters: the tilt angle of the duct with respect to the horizontal, $\\theta$ (a few degrees at most), and the Reynolds number $Re$, an input parameter based on the density difference driving the flow. The flow can be sustained with constant forcing over arbitrarily long times and exhibits a wealth of dynamical behaviours representative of geophysically-relevant sustained stratified shear flows. Varying $\\theta$ and $Re$ leads to four qualitatively different regimes: laminar flow; mostly laminar flow with finite-amplitude, travelling Holmboe waves; spatio-temporally intermittent turbulence with substantial interfacial mixing; and sustained, vigorous interfacial turbulence (Meyer & Linden, J.

      "Inserting test sample 428  This paper presents a study on the energetics of sustained stratified shear flows during regime transitions. We investigate the behavior of such flows using direct numerical simulations that employ a spectral element method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in a stably stratified fluid. Our simulations reveal that the flow transitions from a laminar state to a regime featuring large-scale, quasi-two-dimensional vortices known as panels/bands, then finally to a state characterized by multiple, interacting panels. We analyze the energetics of the flow during these transitions and find that the onset of the panels significantly alters the energy distribution within the flow. Specifically, we identify an increase in potential energy associated with the formation of the panels, which is consistent with earlier experimental and theoretical studies. We further explore the persistence of this increase in potential energy to understand its role in the transition to a state characterized by interacting panels. Our results suggest that the increase in potential energy is tied to the formation of persistent near-surface structures which are believed to play an important role in the formation of the large-scale panels. Overall, our findings improve our understanding of the energetics of stratified shear flows and provide valuable insights into the mechanics of regime transitions in such flows. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We revisit 3 categories of constraints.

We argue that it will be difficult to push the existing optical microlensing constraints to much lower m$_{\\mathrm{PBH}}$. (2) For dynamical capture of PBHs in stars, we derive a general result on the capture rate based on phase space arguments. We argue that survival of stars does not constrain PBHs, but that disruption of stars by captured PBHs should occur and that the asteroid-mass PBH hypothesis could be constrained if we can work out the observational signature of this process. (3) For destruction of white dwarfs by PBHs that pass through the white dwarf without getting gravitationally captured, but which produce a shock that ignites carbon fusion, we perform a 1+1D hydrodynamic simulation to explore the post-shock temperature and relevant timescales, and again we find this constraint to be ineffective.

      "Inserting test sample 454  The fifth generation (5G) wireless communication network's unprecedented transmission speed and ultra-low latency can be attained through the deployment of massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO). Beamforming, a essential transmission technology in massive MIMO systems, aims to direct the beam to the target user by using the beam index to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel. A common approach to beam index detection for massive MIMO systems is the use of blind detection schemes, which do not require a priori knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). However, blind detection techniques face a challenge in accurately determining the beam index, which can significantly affect the overall spectral efficiency and network performance. This paper investigates the use of channel learning for enhancing 5G blind beam index detection. The proposed approach would integrate channel learning into conventional blind detection strategies, resulting in a more accurate identification of the beam index. Through extensive simulations and analysis, we show that the combined approach offers a significant improvement in beam index detection accuracy compared to conventional blind detection techniques. Our results demonstrate that the exploitation of channel learning can effectively enhance the performance of 5G blind beam index detection, leading to improved network performance and user experience in 5G MIMO systems. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 455  An urban tactical wireless network is considered wherein the base stations are situated on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that provide connectivity to ground assets such as vehicles located on city streets. The UAVs are assumed to be randomly deployed at a fixed height according to a two-dimensional point process. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies are used to avail of large available bandwidths and spatial isolation due to beamforming. In urban environments, mmWave signals are prone to blocking of the line-of-sight (LoS) by buildings. While reflections are possible, the desire for consistent connectivity places a strong preference on the existence of an unblocked LoS path. As such, the key performance metric considered in this paper is the connectivity probability, which is the probability of an unblocked LoS path to at least one UAV within some maximum transmission distance. By leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, the connectivity probability is characterized as a function of the city type (e.g., urban, dense urban, suburban), density of UAVs (average number of UAVs per square km), and height of the UAVs. The city streets are modeled as a Manhattan Poisson Line Process (MPLP) and the building heights are randomly distributed. The analysis first finds the connectivity probability conditioned on a particular network realization (location of the UAVs) and then removes the conditioning to uncover the distribution of the connectivity; i.e., the fraction of network realizations that will fail to meet an outage threshold. While related work has applied an MPLP to networks with a single UAV, the contributions of this paper are that it (1) considers networks of multiple UAVs, (2) characterizes the performance by a connectivity distribution, and (3) identifies the optimal altitude for the UAVs. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Non-invasive sugar sensing has been an active area of research due to its importance to diabetes care. The adsorption of sugars on a template surface study is at the heart of matter. Here, we study doped hexagonal boron nitride sheets ($h$-BNNs) as adsorbing and sensing template for glucose and glucosamine. Using first principles calculations, we find that the adsorption of glucose and glucosamine on $h$-BNNs is significantly enhanced by the substitutional doping of the sheet with Al and Ga. Including long range van der Waals corrections gives adsorption energies of about 2 eV. In addition to the charge transfer occurring between glucose and the Al/Ga-doped BN sheets, the adsorption alters the size of the band gap, allowing for optical detection of adsorption.

      "Inserting test sample 459  The broad use of organic semiconductors for optoelectronic applications relies on quantitative understanding and control of their spectroscopic properties. Of paramount importance are the transport gap - the difference between ionization potential and electron affinity - and the exciton binding energy - inferred from the difference between the transport and optical absorption gaps. Transport gaps are commonly established via photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (PES/IPES). However, PES and IPES are surface-sensitive, average over a dynamic lattice, and are subject to extrinsic effects, leading to significant uncertainty in gaps. Here, we use density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory to calculate the spectroscopic properties of two prototypical organic semiconductors, pentacene and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), quantitatively comparing with measured PES, IPES, and optical absorption spectra. For bulk pentacene and PTCDA, the computed transport gaps are 2.4 and 3.0 eV, and optical gaps are 1.7 and 2.1 eV, respectively. Computed bulk quasiparticle spectra are in excellent agreement with surface-sensitive photoemission measurements over several eV only if the measured gap is reduced by 0.6 eV for pentacene, and 0.6-0.9 eV for PTCDA. We attribute this redshift to several physical effects, including incomplete charge screening at the surface, static and dynamical disorder, and experimental resolution. Optical gaps are in excellent agreement with experiment, with solid-state exciton binding energies of ~0.5 eV for both systems; for pentacene, the exciton is delocalized over several molecules and exhibits significant charge transfer character.

      "Inserting test sample 465  In the present paper I formulate a framework that accommodates many unambiguous discrimination problems. I show that the prior information about any type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to reformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the discrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this framework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal unambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider two cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2) Alternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this case I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters and a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification (UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in coherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The promise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the task is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the reference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution describing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of unknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of beamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can be considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the reference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This perspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after the measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI.\n",

The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown non-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement devices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the difference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled case I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only once. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device must be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses with unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots scenario. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The K2 Mission is providing a unique opportunity to obtain high-precision photometric time series for bright stars along the ecliptic. However, bright targets require a large number of pixels to capture the entirety of the stellar flux, and bandwidth restrictions limit the number and brightness of stars that can be observed. To overcome this, we have developed a new photometric technique, that we call halo photometry, to observe very bright stars using a limited number of pixels. Halo photometry is simple, fast and does not require extensive pixel allocation, and will allow us to use K2 and other photometric missions, such as TESS, to observe very bright stars for asteroseismology and to search for transiting exoplanets. We apply this method to the seven brightest stars in the Pleiades open cluster. Each star exhibits variability; six of the stars show what are most-likely slowly pulsating B-star (SPB) pulsations, with amplitudes ranging from 20 to 2000 ppm.

We present high-quality optical spectra for 12 powerful radio sources at low and intermediate redshifts (z < 0.7) that show evidence for a substantial UV excess. These data were taken using the WHT and VLT to determine the detailed properties of the young stellar populations (YSPs) in the host galaxies as part of a larger project to investigate evolutionary scenarios for the AGN host galaxies. The results of our spectral synthesis model fits to the spectra highlight the importance of taking into account AGN-related components (emission lines, nebular continuum, scattered light) and reddening of the stellar populations in studies of this type. It is also clear that careful examination of the fits to the spectra, as well consideration of auxilary polarimetric and imaging data, are required to avoid degeneracies in the model solutions. In 3/12 sources in our sample we find broad permitted line components, and a combination of AGN-related continuum components and an old (12.5 Gyr) stellar population provides an adequate fit to the data. In the remaining 9 sources we find strong evidence for YSPs. In contrast to some recent studies that suggest relatively old post-starburst ages for the YSPs in radio galaxies (0.3-2.5 Gyr), we deduce a wide range of ages for the YSPs in our sample objects (0.02-1.5 Gyr), with ~50% of the sample showing evidence for young YSP ages (<~0.1 Gyr) in their nuclear regions. The nuclear YSPs are often significantly reddened (0.2 < E(B-V) < 1.4) and make up a substantial fraction (~1-35%) of the total stellar mass in the regions sampled by the spectroscopic slits. Moreover, in all the cases in which we have sufficient spatial resolution we find that the UV excess is extended across the full measureable extent of the galaxy (typically 5-30 kpc), suggesting galaxy-wide starbursts. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 483  In this paper, we study asynchronous federated learning (FL) in a wireless distributed learning network (WDLN). To allow each edge device to use its local data more efficiently via asynchronous FL, transmission scheduling in the WDLN for asynchronous FL should be carefully determined considering system uncertainties, such as time-varying channel and stochastic data arrivals, and the scarce radio resources in the WDLN. To address this, we propose a metric, called an effectivity score, which represents the amount of learning from asynchronous FL. We then formulate an Asynchronous Learning-aware transmission Scheduling (ALS) problem to maximize the effectivity score and develop three ALS algorithms, called ALSA-PI, BALSA, and BALSA-PO, to solve it. If the statistical information about the uncertainties is known, the problem can be optimally and efficiently solved by ALSA-PI. Even if not, it can be still optimally solved by BALSA that learns the uncertainties based on a Bayesian approach using the state information reported from devices. BALSA-PO suboptimally solves the problem, but it addresses a more restrictive WDLN in practice, where the AP can observe a limited state information compared with the information used in BALSA. We show via simulations that the models trained by our ALS algorithms achieve performances close to that by an ideal benchmark and outperform those by other state-of-the-art baseline scheduling algorithms in terms of model accuracy, training loss, learning speed, and robustness of learning.

While this is becoming technically feasible with the latest generation of highly stabilised spectrographs, it is astrophysical noise that sets the true fundamental barrier on attainable RV precisions. In this paper we parameterise the impact of solar surface magneto-convection on absorption line profiles, and extend the analysis from the solar disc centre (Paper I) to the solar limb. Off disc-centre, the plasma flows orthogonal to the granule tops begin to lie along the line-of-sight and those parallel to the granule tops are no longer completely aligned with the observer.

For theories with a parametrically large gap, the amplitude is dominated by spin-2 exchanges and we show how the crossing equations naturally lead to the construction of AdS exchange Witten diagrams. We also show how this is encoded in the anomalous dimensions of double-trace operators of large spin and large twist. We use the chaos bound to prove that the anomalous dimensions are negative. Extending these results to correlators containing two scalars and two conserved currents, we show how to reproduce the CEMZ constraint that the three-point function between two currents and one stress tensor only contains the structure given by Einstein-Maxwell theory in AdS, up to small corrections. Finally, we consider the case where operators of unbounded spin contribute to the Regge amplitude, whose net effect is captured by summing the leading Regge trajectory.

C$_2$H is a molecule typically found in PDR regions of our own Galaxy but there is evidence to suggest it also traces other regions undergoing energetic processing in extragalactic environments. As part of the ALCHEMI ALMA large program, the emission of C$_2$H in the central molecular zone of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 was mapped at 1.6 \" (28 pc) resolution and characterized to understand its chemical origins. Spectral modelling of the N=1-0 through N=4-3 rotational transitions of C$_2$H was used to derive the C$_2$H column densities towards the dense clouds in NGC 253. Chemical modelling, including PDR, dense cloud, and shock models were then used to investigate the chemical processes and physical conditions that are producing the molecular emission. We find high C$_2$H column densities of $\\sim 10^{15} cm^{-3}$ detected towards the dense regions of NGC 253. We further find that these column densities cannot be reproduced by assuming that the emission arises from the PDR regions at the edge of the clouds.

      "Inserting test sample 509  Theoretical modeling of the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies is crucially important to correctly extract cosmological information from redshift surveys. The task is complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift space distortion effects, which change with halo mass, and by the wide distribution of halo masses and their occupations by galaxies. One of the main modeling challenges is the existence of satellite galaxies that have both radial distribution and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon known as the Finger-of-God effect. We present a model for the galaxy power spectrum of in which we decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxies and relate different contributions to 1- and 2-halo terms in a halo model. Our primary goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have physically meaningful values, and are not just fitting parameters. For the 2-halo terms we use the previously developed RSD modeling of halos in the context of distribution function and perturbation theory approach. This term needs to be multiplied by the effect of radial distances and velocities of satellites inside the halo. To this one needs to add the 1-halo terms, which are non-perturbative. We show that the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled as almost constant, with the finite extent of the satellites inside the halo inducing a small k^2R^2 term, where R is related to the size of the halo. We adopt a similar model for FoG in redshift space, ensuring that FoG velocity dispersion is related to the halo mass. For FoG k^2 type expansions do not work and FoG resummation must be used instead. We test several damping functions to model the velocity dispersion FoG effect.

We confirm that adding cells in latitude tends to speed up the dynamo cycle whereas adding cells in radius more than triples the period. We find that the cycle period in the four cells model is less sensitive to the flow speed than in the other simpler meridional circulation profiles studied. Moreover, our studies show that adding cells in radius or in latitude seems to favour the parity switching to a quadrupolar solution. According to our numerical models, the observed 22-yr cycle and dipolar parity is easily reproduced by models including multicellular meridional flows.

A thorough analysis of the phase diagrams of these models is presented using Monte Carlo simulations and renormalization group (RG) techniques. Our results show that the Potts model exhibits a rich phase behavior, including a first-order phase transition and a continuous phase transition as the temperature is varied. On the other hand, the RSOS model presents a more conventional phase diagram with only one continuous transition. We also explore the topological properties of the system and find that the Potts model manifests winding number fluctuations at the critical point, a behavior that is not observed in the RSOS model. Our findings reveal the intriguing properties of these complex-temperature models and enhance our understanding of the phase behavior of statistical lattice models in general. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The strength of [O III] 5007 is modulated by the covering factor, CF, of the narrow line region (NLR) gas, its density n_e, and ionization parameter U. To explore which of these factors produces the observed large range in [O III] 5007 strength, we measure the strength of the matching narrow Hb and [O III] 4363 lines, detected in 40 out of the 87 z<0.5 PG quasars in the Boroson & Green sample.

      "Optical and near-IR observations of jet-driving sources are often hindered by the presence of a natal envelope. Jets around partly embedded sources are a useful diagnostic to constrain the geometry of the concealed protoplanetary disk. In fact, the jet-driving mechanisms are affected by both spatial anisotropies and episodic variations at the (sub-)au scale from the star. We obtained a rich set of high-contrast VLT/SPHERE observations from 0.6 micron to 2.2 micron of the young intermediate-mass star RY Tau. Given the proximity to the Sun of this source, our images have the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for an atomic jet. Optical observations in polarized light show no sign of the protoplanetary disk detected by ALMA. Instead, we observed a diffuse signal resembling a remnant envelope with an outflow cavity. The jet is detected in four spectral lines. The jet appears to be wiggling and its radial width increasing with the distance is complementary to the shape of the outflow cavity suggesting a strong jet/envelope interaction. Through the estimated tangential velocity, we revealed a possible connection between the launching time of the jet sub-structures and the stellar activity of RY Tau. RY Tau is at an intermediate stage toward the dispersal of the natal envelope. This source shows episodic increases of mass accretion/ejection similarly to other known intermediate-mass stars. The amount of observed jet wiggle is consistent with the presence of a precessing disk warp or misaligned inner disk that would be induced by an unseen planetary/sub-stellar companion at sub-/few-au scales.

Through extensive magnetic susceptibility, transport, thermodynamic, and x-ray diffraction measurements, we reveal the evolution of the electronic ground state as a function of Fe substitution. In the absence of Fe, CeRu2Al10 is known to exhibit Kondo semiconducting behavior, characterized by a resistivity minimum and a rapid suppression of the magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures.

A magnetic ordering process emerges in the sample at x=0.3 as evidenced by a significant increase in the magnetic susceptibility and an associated transition to an insulating ground state. We propose that this abrupt phase transition is associated with the presence of a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction that is known to arise due to the coexistence of localized and itinerant electron behavior. This behavior is further confirmed through our analysis of specific heat measurements, which demonstrate a striking increase in the electronic entropy at low temperatures.

This conservation law enables us to define a local mass in the bulk. We show that there is a unique generalization of the dark radiation on the brane, which is given by the local mass. We find there also exists a conserved current associated with the Weyl tensor, and the corresponding local charge, which we call the Weyl charge, is given by the sum of the local mass and a certain linear combination of the components of the bulk energy-momentum tensor. This expression of the Weyl charge relates the local mass with the projected Weyl tensor, $E_{\\mu\\nu}$, which plays a central role in the geometrical formalism of the RS braneworld. On the brane, in particular, this gives a decomposition of the projected Weyl tensor into the local mass and the bulk energy-momentum tensor. Then, as an application of these results, we consider a null dust model for the bulk energy-momentum tensor and discuss the black hole formation in the bulk. We investigate the causal structure by identifying the locus of the apparent horizon and clarify possible brane trajectories in the bulk. We find that the brane stays always outside the black hole as long as it is expanding.

We find that the X-ray enhancement is $\\sim$6' or $\\sim$100 pc across, and is concentrated to the north and west of the densest part of the cloud. We modeled the X-ray enhancement with a variety of spectral models. A single-temperature equilibrium plasma model yields a temperature of $(3.69^{+0.47}_{-0.44}) \\times 10^6$ K and a 0.4-2.0 keV luminosity of $7.9 \\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. However, this model underpredicts the on-enhancement emission around 1 keV, which may indicate the additional presence of hotter plasma ($T \\gtrsim 10^7$ K), or that recombination emission is important. We examined several different physical models for the origin of the X-ray enhancement. We find that turbulent mixing of cold cloud material with hot ambient material, compression or shock heating of a hot ambient medium, and charge exchange reactions between cloud atoms and ions in a hot ambient medium all lead to emission that is too faint. In addition, shock heating in a cool or warm medium leads to emission that is too soft (for reasonable cloud speeds). We find that magnetic reconnection could plausibly power the observed X-ray emission, but resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations are needed to test this hypothesis.

Yet, much smaller haloes with masses 10^9 Msun/h and circular velocities v_circ about 20 km/s readily fill the voids: there should be almost 1000 of these haloes in a 20 Mpc/h void. A typical void of diameter 20 Mpc/h contains about 50 haloes with v_circ > 50 km/s. The haloes are arranged in a pattern, which looks like a miniature Universe: it has the same structural elements as the large-scale structure of the galactic distribution of the Universe.

      "Inserting test sample 631  Propagation characteristics of a wave are defined by the dispersion relationship, from which the governing partial differential equation (PDE) can be recovered. PDEs are commonly solved numerically using the finite-difference (FD) method, with stencils constructed from truncated Taylor series expansions which, whilst typically providing good approximation of the PDE in the space-time domain, often differ considerably from the original partial differential in the wavenumber-frequency domain where the dispersion relationship is defined. Consequentially, stable, high-order FD schemes may not necessarily result in realistic wave behavior, commonly exhibiting numerical dispersion: lagging high-frequency components as a product of discretization. A method for optimizing FD stencil weightings via constrained minimization to better approximate the partial derivative in the wavenumber domain is proposed, allowing for accurate propagation with coarser grids than would be otherwise possible. This was applied to second derivatives on a standard grid and first derivatives on a staggered grid. To evaluate the efficacy of the method, a pair of numerical simulations were devised to compare spatially-optimized stencils with conventional formulations of equivalent extent. A spatially-optimized formulation of the 1D acoustic wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions is presented, evaluating performance at a range of grid spacings, examining the interval between the theoretical maximum grid spacings for the conventional and optimized schemes in finer detail. The optimized scheme was found to offer superior performance for undersampled wavefields and heavily oversampled wavefields.

The application of finite-difference schemes is an efficient and widely used technique for modeling wave equations, but it suffers from numerical dispersion, which causes artificial frequency-dependent attenuation and phase distortion, particularly at high frequencies and steep waves. Therefore, it is of great practical interest to design spatially optimized finite-difference schemes that can effectively suppress numerical dispersion and reduce computational cost. This study presents an extensive investigation of various spatial optimization techniques, such as optimized higher-order spatial operators and optimized grid spacing, and their effects on dispersion suppression, accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency in seismic modeling. The numerical experiments show that the optimized schemes can significantly reduce numerical dispersion, yield higher accuracy, and improve stability, especially when coupled with high-order time-stepping algorithms, for a range of seismic scenarios. Furthermore, the optimized schemes can reduce the total number of grid points required to achieve a given level of accuracy, thus reducing computational cost without sacrificing quality.

We estimate turbulence strength from the energy supplied by dust accretion, using the radial drift velocity of the dust particles in a laminar disk. Our estimate of the turbulence strength agrees with previous analytical and numerical research on the turbulence induced by Kelvin-Helmholtz and/or streaming instabilities for particles whose stopping time is less than the Keplerian time.

In addition we compare the [Ne II] line with optical forbidden lines observed for three stars with UVES. The [Ne II] line was detected in 7 stars, among them the first confirmed detection of [Ne II] in a Herbig Be star, V892 Tau. In four cases, the large blueshifted lines indicate an origin in a jet. In two stars, the small shifts and asymmetric profiles indicate an origin in a photo-evaporative wind. CoKu Tau 1, seen close to edge-on, shows a spatially unresolved line centered at the stellar rest velocity, although cross-dispersion centroids move within 10 AU from one side of the star to the other as a function of wavelength. The line profile is symmetric with wings extending up to about +-80 km/s. The origin of the [Ne II] line could either be due to the bipolar jet or to the disk. For the stars with VLT-UVES observations, in several cases, the optical forbidden line profiles and shifts are very similar to the profile of the [Ne II] line, suggesting that the lines are emitted in the same region.

      "Inserting test sample 651  Open inflation scenario is attracting a renewed interest in the context of string landscape. Since there are a large number of metastable de Sitter vacua in string landscape, tunneling transitions to lower metastable vacua through the bubble nucleation occur quite naturally. Although the deviation of Omega_0 from unity is small by the observational bound, we argue that the effect of this small deviation on the large angle CMB anisotropies can be significant for tensor-type perturbation in open inflation scenario. We consider the situation in which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum tunneling and that of the slow-roll inflation in the nucleated bubble. If the potential just after tunneling is steep enough, a rapid-roll phase appears before the slow-roll inflation. In this case the power spectrum is basically determined by the Hubble rate during the slow-roll inflation. If such rapid-roll phase is absent, the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high energy density there in the large angular components. The amplitude of large angular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation mode if the bubble wall tension is small. Therefore, one can construct some models in which the deviation of Omega_0 from unity is large enough to produce measurable effects. We also consider a more general class of models, where the false vacuum decay may occur due to Hawking-Moss tunneling, as well as the models involving more than one scalar field. We discuss scalar perturbations in these models and point out that a large set of such models is already ruled out by observational data, unless there was a very long stage of slow-roll inflation after the tunneling.

      "Inserting test sample 657  In recent years, the utilization of rotating parts, e.g. bearings and gears, has been continuously supporting the manufacturing line to produce consistent output quality. Due to their critical role, the breakdown of these components might significantly impact the production rate. A proper condition based monitoring (CBM) is among a few ways to maintain and monitor the rotating systems. Prognosis, as one of the major tasks in CBM that predicts and estimates the remaining useful life of the machine, has attracted significant interest in decades. This paper presents a literature review on prognosis approaches from published papers in the last decade. The prognostic approaches are described comprehensively to provide a better idea on how to select an appropriate prognosis method for specific needs. An advanced predictive analytics, namely Parsimonious Network Based on Fuzzy Inference System (PANFIS), was proposed and tested into the low speed slew bearing data. PANFIS differs itself from conventional prognostic approaches in which it supports for online lifelong prognostics without the requirement of retraining or reconfiguration phase. The method is applied to normal-to-failure bearing vibration data collected for 139 days and to predict the time-domain features of vibration slew bearing signals. The performance of the proposed method is compared to some established methods such as ANFIS, eTS, and Simp_eTS. From the results, it is suggested that PANFIS offers outstanding performance compared to those of other methods. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 658  This paper proposes a Parsimonious Network based on Fuzzy Inference System (PANFIS) for predicting time series features in the context of low speed slew bearing prognosis. Slew bearings are critical components of large machinery and failure of these bearings can lead to significant downtime and repair costs. Thus, early and accurate prognosis of potential failures is crucial.\n",

      "To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed model, we perform experiments on a real-world dataset from the bearing vibration analysis used in rotating machinery. The results show that the PANFIS model outperforms both traditional statistical methods and other commonly used models in time series prediction. In particular, our model achieves high prediction accuracy while requiring fewer parameters, which means that it can operate efficiently in real-time applications.\n",

      "Inserting test sample 661  Superoxide reductase (SOR) is an Fe protein that catalyzes the reduction of superoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into alanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has allowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with H(2)O(2) [Math{\\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further investigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a M{\\\"o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted quickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\\\"o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in conjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of density functional calculations on related models, that this species corresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\\\"o}ssbauer parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5) mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\\\"o}ssbauer and spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature [Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group [Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2 and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2, approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied (minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s, respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range [Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.\n",

      "Inserting test sample 667  In contrast to the previous reports that the divalent perovskite SrCrO$_3$ was believed to be cubic structure and nonmagnetic metal, recent measurements suggest coexistence of majority tetragonally distorted weak antiferromagnetic phase and minority nonmagnetic cubic phase. Within the local (spin) density approximation (L(S)DA) our calculations confirm that a slightly tetragonally distorted phase indeed is energetically favored. Using the correlated band theory method (LDA+ Hubbard U) as seems to be justified by the unusual behavior observed in SrCrO$_3$, above the critical value $U_c$=4 eV only the distorted phase undergoes an orbital-ordering transition, resulting in $t_{2g}^2 --> d_{xy}^1$($d_{xz}d_{yz}$)$^1$ corresponding to the filling of the $d_{xy}$ orbital but leaving the other two degenerate. The Fermi surfaces of the cubic phase are simple with nesting features, although the nesting wavevectors do not correlate with known data. This is not uncommon in perovskites; the strongly directional d-d bonding often leads to boxlike Fermi surfaces, and either the nesting is not strong enough, or the matrix elements are not large enough, to promote instabilities. Fixed spin moment calculations indicate the cubic structure is just beyond a ferromagnetic Stoner instability (IN(0)~1.1) in L(S)DA, and that the energy is unusually weakly dependent on the moment out to 1.5$\\mu_B$/Cr (varying only by 11 meV/Cr), reflecting low energy long-wavelength magnetic fluctuations.

By analyzing the electronic structure of SrCrO3, we identify the Cr 3d electrons as the source of the orbital ordering. Our results suggest that the distortion is driven by a Jahn-Teller instability, where the electrons occupy particular atomic orbitals resulting in a lower symmetry. The distortion has significant implications for the magnetism and electronic properties of SrCrO3. We find that the ferromagnetic behavior predicted in cubic SrCrO3 is suppressed in the distorted structure, and a nonmagnetic ground state is stabilized. This result is consistent with experimental observations, where SrCrO3 is typically found to be in a nonmagnetic state. Our findings provide insights into the interplay between the crystal structure and electronic properties of SrCrO3, and highlight the role of orbital ordering in driving structural distortion in transition metal oxides.

For two typical YBCO films, J^\\ast predictions agree with observations to within 5%.

      "Inserting test sample 681  By numerically integrating the orbits of the giant planets and of test particles over a period of four billion years, we follow the evolution of the location of the midplane of the Kuiper belt. The Classical Kuiper belt conforms to a warped sheet that precesses with a 1.9 Myr period. The present-day location of the Kuiper belt plane can be computed using linear secular perturbation theory: the local normal to the plane is given by the theory's forced inclination vector, which is specific to every semimajor axis. The Kuiper belt plane does not coincide with the invariable plane, but deviates from it by up to a few degrees in stable zones. For example, at a semimajor axis of 38 AU, the local Kuiper belt plane has an inclination of 1.9 deg and a longitude of ascending node of 149.9 deg when referred to the mean ecliptic and equinox of J2000. At a semimajor axis of 43 AU, the local plane has an inclination of 1.9 deg and a nodal longitude of 78.3 deg. Only at infinite semimajor axis does the Kuiper belt plane merge with the invariable plane, whose inclination is 1.6 deg and nodal longitude is 107.7 deg. A Kuiper belt object keeps its inclination relative to the Kuiper belt plane nearly constant, even while the latter plane departs from the trajectory predicted by linear theory.

A fast implementation of the bilateral filter was recently proposed in [2] that required O(1) operations per pixel with respect to \\sigma_s. This was done by using trigonometric functions for the range kernel of the bilateral filter, and by exploiting their so-called shiftability property. In particular, a fast implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter was realized by approximating the Gaussian range kernel using raised cosines. Later, it was demonstrated in [3] that this idea could be extended to a larger class of filters, including the popular non-local means filter [4]. As already observed in [2], a flip side of this approach was that the run time depended on the width \\sigma_r of the range kernel. For an image with (local) intensity variations in the range [0,T], the run time scaled as O(T^2/\\sigma^2_r) with \\sigma_r. This made it difficult to implement narrow range kernels, particularly for images with large dynamic range. We discuss this problem in this note, and propose some simple steps to accelerate the implementation in general, and for small \\sigma_r in particular.\n",

It is more complicated than conventional similarity search, and needs to consider not only visual aesthetics but also the intrinsic fine-grained and multi-category nature of fashion items. Some existing approaches solve the problem through sequential models or learning pair-wise distances between items. However, most of them only consider coarse category information in defining fashion compatibility while neglecting the fine-grained category information often desired in practical applications. To better define the fashion compatibility and more flexibly meet different needs, we propose a novel problem of learning compatibility among multiple tuples (each consisting of an item and category pair), and recommending fashion items following the category choices from customers. Our contributions include: 1) Designing a Mixed Category Attention Net (MCAN) which integrates both fine-grained and coarse category information into recommendation and learns the compatibility among fashion tuples. MCAN can explicitly and effectively generate diverse and controllable recommendations based on need. 2) Contributing a new dataset IQON, which follows eastern culture and can be used to test the generalization of recommendation systems.

      "Inserting test sample 697  The observation of a 0.5 conductance plateau in asymmetrically biased quantum point contacts with in-plane side gates has been attributed to the onset of spin-polarized current through these structures. For InAs quantum point contacts with the same width but longer channel length, there is roughly a fourfold increase in the range of common sweep voltage applied to the side gates over which the 0.5 conductance plateau is observed when the QPC aspect ratio (ratio of length over width of the narrow portion of the structure) is increased by a factor 3. Non-equilibrium Green s function simulations indicate that the increase in the size of the 0.5 conductance plateau is due to an increased importance, over a larger range of common sweep voltage, of the effects of electron-electron interactions in QPC devices with larger aspect ratio. The use of asymmetrically biased QPCs with in-plane side gates and large aspect ratio could therefore pave the way to build robust spin injectors and detectors for the successful implementation of spin field effect transistors 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We confirm the previously reported detections of 3C 120 and 3C 111 in the GeV photon energy range; a detailed look at the temporal characteristics of the observed gamma-ray emission reveals in addition possible flux variability in both sources. No statistically significant gamma-ray detection of the other BLRGs was however found in the considered dataset. Though the sample size studied is small, what appears to differentiate 3C 111 and 3C 120 from the BLRGs not yet detected in gamma-rays is the particularly strong nuclear radio flux. This finding, together with the indications of the gamma-ray flux variability and a number of other arguments presented, indicate that the GeV emission of BLRGs is most likely dominated by the beamed radiation of relativistic jets observed at intermediate viewing angles. In this paper we also analyzed a comparison sample of high accretion-rate Seyfert 1 galaxies, which can be considered radio-quiet counterparts of BLRGs, and found none were detected in gamma-rays. A simple phenomenological hybrid model applied for the broad-band emission of the discussed radio-loud and radio-quiet type 1 active galaxies suggests that the relative contribution of the nuclear jets to the accreting matter is > 1 percent on average for BLRGs, whilst <0.1 percent for Seyfert 1 galaxies. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We find that the gamma-ray emission in BLRGs is consistent with a leptonic scenario, in which relativistic electrons are accelerated by the same mechanisms that produce the radio synchrotron emission. We also discuss the possibility that the gamma-ray emission in BLRGs may partially originate from hadronic processes, which would imply the presence of a population of high-energy protons within the radio jets.

Such a structure manifests due to the overlap of the valence and conduction bands in the crystalline lattice, forming a curve in the Brillouin zone instead of a point.

      "Inserting test sample 709  The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can overcome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a critical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum computers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a \"break-even\" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20 times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an uncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states).

The lifetime of stored quantum information is limited by the decoherence time, which is the time scale over which quantum states evolve uncontrollably due to their interactions with the environment. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantum error correction protocol that extends the lifetime of quantum information by more than an order of magnitude. Our protocol employs a custom-designed five-qubit circuit that encodes a logical qubit, uses standard Clifford gates and non-Clifford gates, and implements syndrome measurements. We experimentally demonstrate that this protocol effectively corrects for the collective dephasing error caused by the two-qubit gates in the circuit, by monitoring the evolution of the logical qubit over time. We further quantify the effect of the correction by measuring the average logical state fidelity and the logical phase flip error for varying lengths of time. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our protocol in correcting for both coherent and incoherent errors, and demonstrate that it can extend the coherent lifetime of the logical qubit by up to two orders of magnitude. This work represents an important step towards the realization of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers with lifetimes extended beyond the decoherence time scales of individual qubits.

The proposed framework includes several modules for perception, decision-making, and control, which operate together to enable the robot to navigate in unknown and dynamic environments autonomously. The perception module incorporates state-of-the-art sensors and object detection techniques to perceive the robot's surroundings accurately and efficiently. The decision-making module utilizes a combination of rule-based and learning-based approaches to reason about high-level human-like interaction and task planning. Finally, the control module integrates the output from the decision-making module to execute the planned task approach.

In the board interlock network, it allows us to assess the extent to which the footprint of a national network is still present within the global network. Next, the measure of centrality ranking dominance tells us whether a partition (country) is more dominant at the top or the bottom of the centrality ranking of the full (global) network.

The other Class I sources, TMC-1A and L1489 IRS, exhibit the fastest rotational motions among the sample, and their rotational motions have flatter radial profiles of Vrot ~ r^{-0.6+/-0.1} and ~ r^{-0.5+/-0.1}, respectively. The rotational motions with the radial dependence of ~ r^{-1} can be interpreted as rotation with a conserved angular momentum in a dynamically infalling envelope, while those with the radial dependence of ~ r^{-0.5} can be interpreted as Keplerian rotation. These observational results demonstrate categorization of rotational motions from infalling envelopes to Keplerian-disk formation. Models of the inside-out collapse where the angular momentum is conserved are discussed and compared with our observational results. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 742  Low-mass protostars are the basic building blocks of stars. Unraveling their formation sequence is essential to understand the evolution of stars in our galaxy. In this paper, we present an evolutionary scenario that takes infalling envelopes to Keplerian disks around low-mass protostars, based on the physical properties and dynamics of the system. By observing the continuum and spectral line emissions from the envelopes and disks, we compile a sample of protostars in various stages of evolution. We find that infalling envelopes typically last for a few thousand years and have a significant impact on the subsequent disk formation. We analyze the rotation profiles of the disks and find that they gradually become Keplerian with time. The Keplerian disks are characterized by a higher angular momentum and a flattened structure. We employ detailed numerical simulations to reproduce our observations and investigate the underlying physics driving the system's evolution. Our simulations reveal that the dust evolution and magnetic fields play a crucial role in shaping the envelopes and disks.

      "Inserting test sample 767  Spontaneous self-assembly in molecular systems is a fundamental route to both biological and engineered soft matter. Simple micellisation, emulsion formation, and polymer mixing principles are well understood. However, the principles behind emergence of structures with competing length scales in soft matter systems remain an open question. Examples include the droplet-inside-droplet assembly in many biomacromolecular systems undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation, analogous multiple emulsion formation in oil-surfactant-water formulations, and polymer core-shell particles with internal structure. We develop here a microscopic theoretical model based on effective interactions between the constituents of a soft matter system to explain self-organization both at single and multiple length scales. The model identifies how spatial ordering at multiple length scales emerges due to competing interactions between the system components, e.g. molecules of different sizes and different chemical properties. As an example of single and multiple-length-scale assembly, we map out a generic phase diagram for a solution with two solute species differing in their mutual and solvent interactions. By performing molecular simulations on a block-copolymer system, we further demonstrate how the phase diagram can be connected to a molecular system that has a transition from regular single-core polymer particles to multi-core aggregates that exhibit multiple structural length scales.

We confirm the mass segregation for the massive stars (m >~ 8 Msun) by a minimum spanning tree analysis. Using a Monte Carlo method, we estimate the total mass of NGC 6231 to be about 2.6 (+/- 0.6) x 10^3 Msun. We constrain the age of NGC 6231 by comparison with evolutionary isochrones.

      "Inserting test sample 789  Supervised cross-modal hashing aims to embed the semantic correlations of heterogeneous modality data into the binary hash codes with discriminative semantic labels. Because of its advantages on retrieval and storage efficiency, it is widely used for solving efficient cross-modal retrieval. However, existing researches equally handle the different tasks of cross-modal retrieval, and simply learn the same couple of hash functions in a symmetric way for them. Under such circumstance, the uniqueness of different cross-modal retrieval tasks are ignored and sub-optimal performance may be brought.\n",

      "Motivated by this, we present a Task-adaptive Asymmetric Deep Cross-modal Hashing (TA-ADCMH) method in this paper. It can learn task-adaptive hash functions for two sub-retrieval tasks via simultaneous modality representation and asymmetric hash learning. Unlike previous cross-modal hashing approaches, our learning framework jointly optimizes semantic preserving that transforms deep features of multimedia data into binary hash codes, and the semantic regression which directly regresses query modality representation to explicit label. With our model, the binary codes can effectively preserve semantic correlations across different modalities, meanwhile, adaptively capture the query semantics.

The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges that arise when cross-modality retrieval is performed, as modalities are often heterogeneous and the features differ in their semantic or discriminative information. We adopt a task-based approach in the proposed method, where the hash codes are learned by maximizing the retrieval performance of a particular query task. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic triplet constraint that exploits the underlying relevance between modalities, making the learned hash codes more task-sensitive. Moreover, to alleviate the computational complexity in the retrieval stage, an asymmetric hashing network is designed, which allows for compact hash codes without sacrificing the retrieval accuracy. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art hashing approaches. In conclusion, the task-adaptive asymmetric deep cross-modal hashing is a promising approach for cross-modal retrieval, which can be widely applied in multimedia analysis, recommendation systems, and other related fields. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 791  Dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) are commonly used to generate cold plasmas at atmospheric pressure. Whatever their configuration (tubular or planar), the presence of a dielectric barrier is mandatory to prevent too much charge build up in the plasma and the formation of a thermal arc. In this article, the role of the barrier thickness (2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 mm) and of the kind of dielectric material (alumina, mullite, pyrex, quartz) is investigated on the filamentary behavior in the plasma and on the CO2 conversion in a tubular flowing DBD, by means of mass spectrometry measurements correlated with electrical characterization and IR imaging. Increasing the barrier thickness decreases the capacitance, while preserving the electrical charge. As a result, the voltage over the dielectric increases and a larger number of microdischarges is generated, which enhances the CO2 conversion. Furthermore, changing the dielectric material of the barrier, while keeping the same geometry and dimensions, also affects the CO2 conversion. The highest CO2 conversion and energy efficiency are obtained for quartz and alumina, thus not following the trend of the relative permittivity. From the electrical characterization, we clearly demonstrate that the most important parameters are the somewhat higher effective plasma voltage (yielding a somewhat higher electric field and electron energy in the plasma) for quartz, as well as the higher plasma current (and thus larger electron density) and the larger number of microdischarge filaments (mainly for alumina, but also for quartz). The latter could be correlated to the higher surface roughness for alumina and to the higher voltage over the dielectric for quartz. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 792  This study examines the effect of barrier thickness and dielectric material on the filamentary mode and CO2 conversion in a flowing dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. By varying the thickness of the dielectric barrier from 0.5 to 1.2 mm, we observed that the discharge voltage increased with barrier thickness, while the discharge current decreased owing to a decrease in the electric field. Furthermore, time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy (TROES) measurements were employed to investigate the generation and evolution of the filamentary modes. The results showed that the thickness of the dielectric barrier significantly influenced the morphology and distribution of the filaments. In particular, a thicker barrier promoted the transition from a discrete to a diffuse filamentary mode. Finally, we evaluated the CO2 conversion performance of the reactor by introducing CO2 as the target gas and monitoring its conversion rate. The highest CO2 conversion rate was observed for a reactor with a 0.9 mm dielectric barrier. The result was attributed to the balance between the electric field strength, the energy density, and the rate of electron dissociation of CO2 molecules. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the effect of barrier thickness and dielectric material on the filamentary mode and CO2 conversion performance in a flowing DBD reactor, which can inform the design of more efficient plasma-based reactors for CO2 conversion. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We use a sample of over 300 spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members and > 1000 galaxies in the field, and classify them according to their halo mass using weak lensing measurements. Our main findings are that galaxies with higher halo masses tend to have higher stellar masses, lower specific star formation rates, and are more likely to be quenched. Additionally, we find that the environmental quenching efficiency, defined as the fraction of quenched galaxies in denser environments compared to the field, increases with halo mass. This suggests that the process of environmental quenching is more effective in more massive halos. However, we also find some evidence for a mass threshold below which the environment has no significant effect on quenching, indicating that internal mechanisms such as feedback from active galactic nuclei could also play a role. Our results have important implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution and the role of the environment in driving this evolution.

We compare the observed LFs of five galaxies containing young star clusters with synthetic cluster population models with varying initial conditions. The LF of the SMC, the LMC and NGC 5236 are characterized by a power-law behavior NdL~L^-a dL, with a mean exponent of <a> = 2.0 +/- 0.2. This can be explained by a cluster population formed with a constant cluster formation rate, in which the maximum cluster mass per logarithmic age bin is determined by the size-of-sample effect and therefore increases with log(age/yr). The LFs of NGC 6946 and M51 are better described by a double power-law distribution or a Schechter function. When a cluster population has a mass function that is truncated below the limit given by the size-of-sample effect, the total LF shows a bend at the magnitude of the maximum mass, with the age of the oldest cluster in the population, typically a few Gyr due to disruption. For NGC 6946 and M51 this implies a maximum mass of M_max = 5*10^5 M_sun. Faint-ward of the bend the LF has the same slope as the underlying initial cluster mass function and bright-ward of the bend it is steeper.

The dispersion of the C/O and N/O ratios in these galaxies is found to be remarkably small, being only +/-0.03 dex and +/-0.02 dex respectively. This very small dispersion is strong evidence against any time-delayed production of C and primary N in the lowest-metallicity BCGs (secondary N production is negligible at these low metallicities).

By carefully studying the following properties of GBM-190816 using Fermi/GBM data, including signal-to-noise ratio, duration, f-parameter, spectral properties, energetic properties, and its compliance with some GRB statistical correlations, we confirm that this event is likely a typical short GRB. Assuming its association with the sub-threshold GW event, the inferred luminosity is $1.47_{-1.04}^{+3.40} \\times 10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Based on the available information of the sub-threshold GW event, we infer the mass ratio q of the compact binary as $q=2.26_{-1.43}^{+2.75}$ according to the reported range of luminosity distance. If the heavier compact object has a mass > 3 solar masses, q can be further constrained to $q=2.26_{-0.12}^{+2.75}$. The leading physical scenario invokes an NS-BH merger system with the NS tidally disrupted. Within this scenario, we constrain the physical properties of such a system to produce a GRB.

Specifically, we analyze the effect of particle interactions on the fusion reaction by considering their entropic contributions to the system. By incorporating correlation entropy into our calculations, we are able to provide a more complete picture of the fusion process, as it occurs in these different liquid metals. Our results suggest that correlation entropy has a significant impact on the fusion reaction rates in these systems and must be accounted for in future models and simulations. These findings have important implications for efforts to achieve sustainable energy production through nuclear fusion. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 831  The connection between the proper time equation and the Zamolodchikov metric is discussed. The connection is two-fold: First, as already known, the proper time equation is the product of the Zamolodchikov metric and the renormalization group beta function. Second, the condition that the two-point function is the Zamolodchikov metric, implies the proper time equation. We study the massless vector of the open string in detail. In the exactly calculable case of a uniform electromgnetic field strength we recover the Born-Infeld equation. We describe the systematics of the perturbative evaluation of the gauge invariant proper time equation for the massless vector field. The method is valid for non-uniform fields and gives results that are exact to all orders in derivatives. As a non trivial check, we show that in the limit of uniform fields it reproduces the lowest order Born-Infeld equation. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The chosen sources represent a range in Galactocentric radii ($R_{\\rm GC}$) from 0 to 9.8 kpc. The high spectral resolution and sensitivity afforded by the GBT permit isotope ratios to be corrected for optical depths. The optical-depth-corrected data indicate that the secondary-to-primary silicon isotope ratios $^{29}{\\rm Si}/^{28}{\\rm Si}$ and $^{30}{\\rm Si}/^{28}{\\rm Si}$ vary much less than predicted on the basis of other stable isotope ratio gradients across the Galaxy. Indeed, there is no detectable variation in Si isotope ratios with $R_{\\rm GC}$. This lack of an isotope ratio gradient stands in stark contrast to the monotonically decreasing trend with $R_{\\rm GC}$ exhibited by published secondary-to-primary oxygen isotope ratios. These results, when considered in the context of the expectations for chemical evolution, suggest that the reported oxygen isotope ratio trends, and perhaps that for carbon as well, require further investigation.

Using this standard quantization procedure, we show that the horizon is quantized and the black hole singularity disappears. For the first case, quantization of the Schwarzschild radius was obtained in terms of the Planck length $l_{Pl}$, a positive integer $n$ and the ordering factor of the operator $p$. From the quantization of the Schwarzschild radius it was possible to determine the area of the black hole event horizon, its mass and the quantum energy of the Hawking radiation as well as its frequency. For the solution close to the interior black hole singularity, the wave function was determined and applied the DeBroglie-Bohm interpretation. The Bohm's trajectory was found near to the singularity. It which describes how the spacetime evolves over time and depends on the ordering factor of the operator $p$. Thus, for the case where $|1-p|\\neq0,3$, the Bohm's trajectory is finite and regular, that is, the singularity is removed. For the case where $|1-p|=3$, the Bohm's trajectory assumes an exponential behavior, never going to zero, avoiding the singularity.That result allows that spacetime be extended beyond the classical singularity. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We present a follow-up spectroscopic study of this stream based on data taken with the MEGARA instrument at the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias using the integral field spectroscopy mode. Although our data suggest that this compact object in the stream is actually a foreground Milky Way halo star, we detect emission lines overlapping a less compact, bluer and fainter blob of the stream that is clearly visible in both ultra-violet and optical deep images. From its heliocentric systemic radial velocity derived from the [OIII] 5007A lines (V_syst= 1548.58+/-1.80 km\\s^-1) and new UV and optical broad-band photometry, we conclude that this over-density could be the actual core of the stream, with an absolute magnitude of Mg~ -10 and a g-r = 0.08+/- 0.11, consistent with a remnant of a low-mass dwarf satellite undergoing a current episode of star formation. From the width of the stream, we calculate that the progenitor mass is between 6.4 x 10^6 Mo -2.7 x 10^7 Mo, which is typical of a dwarf galaxy. These estimates suggest that this is one of the lowest mass streams detected so far beyond the Local Group. We find that blue stellar streams containing star formation regions are commonly predicted by high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxies lighter than the Milky Way. This scenario is consistent with the processes explaining the bursty star formation history of some dwarf satellites, which are followed by a gas depletion and a fast quenching once they enter within the virial radius of their host galaxies. Thus, it is likely that the stream's progenitor is suffering a star-formation burst comparable to those that have shaped the star-formation history of several Local Group dwarfs in the last few Gigayears. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 843  Static bug finders have been widely-adopted by developers to find bugs in real world software projects. They leverage predefined heuristic static analysis rules to scan source code or binary code of a software project, and report violations to these rules as warnings to be verified. However, the advantages of static bug finders are overshadowed by such issues as uncovered obvious bugs, false positives, etc. To improve these tools, many techniques have been proposed to filter out false positives reported or design new static analysis rules. Nevertheless, the under-performance of bug finders can also be caused by the incorrectness of current rules contained in the static bug finders, which is not explored yet. In this work, we propose a differential testing approach to detect bugs in the rules of four widely-used static bug finders, i.e., SonarQube, PMD, SpotBugs, and ErrorProne, and conduct a qualitative study about the bugs found. To retrieve paired rules across static bug finders for differential testing, we design a heuristic-based rule mapping method which combines the similarity in rules description and the overlap in warning information reported by the tools. The experiment on 2,728 open source projects reveals 46 bugs in the static bug finders, among which 24 are fixed or confirmed and the left are awaiting confirmation. We also summarize 13 bug patterns in the static analysis rules based on their context and root causes, which can serve as the checklist for designing and implementing other rules and or in other tools. This study indicates that the commonly-used static bug finders are not as reliable as they might have been envisaged.

WIMP annihilation or decay may produce essentially monochromatic gamma rays detectable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) against the astrophysical gamma-ray emission of the Galaxy. We have searched for spectral lines in the energy range 5--300 GeV using 3.7 years of data, reprocessed with updated instrument calibrations and an improved energy dispersion model compared to the previous Fermi-LAT Collaboration line searches. We searched in five regions selected to optimize sensitivity to different theoretically-motivated dark matter density distributions. We did not find any globally significant lines in our a priori search regions and present 95% confidence limits for annihilation cross sections of self-conjugate WIMPs and decay lifetimes. Our most significant fit occurred at 133 GeV in our smallest search region and had a local significance of 3.3 standard deviations, which translates to a global significance of 1.5 standard deviations. We discuss potential systematic effects in this search, and examine the feature at 133 GeV in detail. We find that both the use of reprocessed data and of additional information in the energy dispersion model contribute to the reduction in significance of the line-like feature near 130 GeV relative to significances reported in other works.

This barrier can be explained by means of the cohesionless rubble-pile structure model. In this paper we will explore the possibility for the observed spin-barrier value to be different for C and S-type Main Asteroids Belt (MBAs). On the basis of the actual bulk density values, the expected ratio between the maximum rotation periods is $P_C/P_S \\approx 1.4 \\pm 0.3$.

Uncertainties are still high, mainly because of the small number of MBAs with known taxonomic class in the considered range. In the 4-10 km range, instead, the ratio between the spin-barriers seems closer to 1 because $P_C/P_S \\approx 1.11 \\pm 0.05$.

Here we perform several N-body experiments to study the effect of an 80,000 solar masses stellar cluster (SC) infalling on a parsec-scale BHB.

We find that the semi-major axis of the BHB shrinks by more than 10 per cent if the SC is on a nearly radial orbit; the shrinking is more efficient when a Dehnen potential is included and the orbital plane of the SC coincides with that of the BHB. In contrast, if the SC orbit has non-zero angular momentum, only a few stars enter the BHB loss cone and the resulting BHB shrinking is negligible.

Using a sample of approximately 2200 dwarf stars, we identify a kinematically distinct group in the solar neighborhood.

We found that the member stars of this group share similar spatial and chemical properties, including metallicity and abundance ratios, suggesting they may have a common origin. The distribution of member stars shows a loose concentration towards a region close to the Sun, with a mean distance of approximately 90 parsecs. Our estimate of the group's velocity dispersion indicates that it is dynamically young, possibly with an age of 2-3 Gyr. Additionally, we explored the group's kinematic properties using a set of dynamical models, providing an insight into its nature and origin. Our results show that the kinematic Group 1 is likely a disrupted open cluster or a moving group, with a possible origin in the thin disk's inner regions.

      "Inserting test sample 863  A novel strategy to handle divergences typical of perturbative calculations is implemented for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and its phenomenological consequences investigated. The central idea of the method is to avoid the critical step involved in the regularization process, namely the explicit evaluation of divergent integrals. This goal is achieved by assuming a regularization distribution in an implicit way and making use, in intermediary steps, only of very general properties of such regularization. The finite parts are separated of the divergent ones and integrated free from effects of the regularization. The divergent parts are organized in terms of standard objects which are independent of the (arbitrary) momenta running in internal lines of loop graphs. Through the analysis of symmetry relations, a set of properties for the divergent objects are identified, which we denominate consistency relations, reducing the number of divergent objects to only a few ones. The calculational strategy eliminates unphysical dependencies of the arbitrary choices for the routing of internal momenta, leading to ambiguity-free, and symmetry-preserving physical amplitudes. We show that the imposition of scale properties for the basic divergent objects leads to a critical condition for the constituent quark mass such that the remaining arbitrariness is removed.\n",

This allows us to study the quantum corrections to the effective potential and the phase structure of the theory. We calculate the one-loop effective potential using a proper-time regularization scheme and find that the inclusion of the auxiliary field leads to a nontrivial dependence on the phase of the chiral condensate. We analyze the phase diagram of the model in the chiral limit and show that it exhibits a second-order phase transition at vanishing temperature and chemical potential. At nonzero chemical potential, we find that the phase transition becomes a crossover.

The strategy has to sample the conversations to form a survey containing enough data analyzed with high accuracy so that proportions can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Due to the unpredictable type of theme mentions, it is appropriate to consider methods for theme hypothesization based on global as well as local feature extraction. Two systems based on each type of feature extraction will be considered by the strategy. One of the four methods is novel. It is based on a new definition of density of theme mentions and on the localization of high density zones whose boundaries do not need to be precisely detected. The sequential decision strategy starts by grouping theme hypotheses into sets of different expected accuracy and coverage levels. For those sets for which accuracy can be improved with a consequent increase of coverage a new system with new features is introduced. Its execution is triggered only when specific preconditions are met on the hypotheses generated by the basic four systems. Experimental results are provided on a corpus collected in the call center of the Paris transportation system known as ratp.

Under this setup, we jointly optimize the one-dimensional (1D) UAV trajectory and wireless resource allocation to reveal the fundamental rate limits of the UAV-enabled MAC, under the users' individual maximum power constraints and the UAV's maximum flight speed constraints. First, we consider the capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission with successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the UAV receiver. In this case, we characterize the capacity region by maximizing the average sum-rate of users subject to rate profile constraints. To optimally solve this highly non-convex problem, we transform the original speed-constrained trajectory optimization problem into a speed-free problem that is optimally solvable via the Lagrange dual decomposition. It is rigorously proved that the optimal 1D trajectory solution follows the successive hover-and-fly (SHF) structure. Next, we consider two orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission schemes, i.e., frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA). We maximize the achievable rate regions in the two cases by jointly optimizing the 1D trajectory design and wireless resource (frequency/time) allocation.

In one parameter perturbations of the Dirac limit, very stringent bounds can be derived on the mass splittings between the almost degenerate pairs of neutrinos. However, we also demonstrate that with suitable changes to the lepton mixing matrix, limits on such mass splittings are much weaker, or even completely absent.

      "Inserting test sample 883  The well-known theorem of Dybvig, Ingersoll and Ross shows that the long zero-coupon rate can never fall. This result, which, although undoubtedly correct, has been regarded by many as surprising, stems from the implicit assumption that the long-term discount function has an exponential tail. We revisit the problem in the setting of modern interest rate theory, and show that if the long \"simple\" interest rate (or Libor rate) is finite, then this rate (unlike the zero-coupon rate) acts viably as a state variable, the value of which can fluctuate randomly in line with other economic indicators. New interest rate models are constructed, under this hypothesis and certain generalizations thereof, that illustrate explicitly the good asymptotic behaviour of the resulting discount bond systems. The conditions necessary for the existence of such \"hyperbolic\" and \"generalized hyperbolic\" long rates are those of so-called social discounting, which allow for long-term cash flows to be treated as broadly \"just as important\" as those of the short or medium term.\n",

Since static traffic assignment does not have a notion of time, it is not designed to represent temporal dynamics that arise as vehicles flow through the network and demand varies through the day. Dynamic traffic assignment methods attempt to resolve these issues, but require significant computational resources if modeling urban-scale regions (on the order of millions of links and vehicles) and often take days of compute time to complete. The focus of this work is two-fold: 1) to introduce a new traffic assignment approach - a quasi-dynamic traffic assignment (QDTA) model and 2) to describe how we parallelized the QDTA algorithms to leverage High-Performance Computing (HPC) and scale to large metropolitan areas while dramatically reducing compute time. We examine and compare different scenarios, including a baseline static traffic assignment (STA) and a quasi-dynamic scenario inspired by the user-equilibrium (UET). Results are presented for the San Francisco Bay Area which accounts for 19M trips/day and an urban road network of 1M links.

A comprehensive description of the experimental setup is presented where flow is generated by a pump in a specially designed container and ultrasound is generated by a piezoelectric transducer which is positioned at a certain distance from the container. The study is conducted by varying the flow rate, angle of incidence, and frequency of ultrasound waves. The scattered ultrasound signals are recorded by a hydrophone and analyzed to reveal the scattering patterns and the ultrasound attenuation coefficient. The results reveal that the scattering patterns depend significantly on the flow rate, angle of incidence, and frequency of the transmitted ultrasound. Analysis of the attenuation coefficient demonstrates that the amount of ultrasound energy lost due to scattering is higher at higher flow rates and larger angles of incidence. This study shows that flow-induced scattering is an essential factor that can affect the performance and accuracy of ultrasound imaging systems that operate in fluid media.

One cannot logically prove properties of a system by establishing, instead, properties of a system modified by adding properties alien to the original system. Hence Griffiths' rejection of hidden-variable-based proofs is logically warranted. Griffiths mentions the existence of a certain alternative proof that does not involve hidden variables, and that uses only macroscopically described observable properties. He notes that he had examined in his book proofs of this general kind, and concluded that they provide no evidence for nonlocal influences. But he did not examine the particular proof that he cites. An examination of that particular proof by the method specified by his 'consistent quantum theory' shows that the cited proof is valid within that restrictive version of quantum theory.

Nevertheless, in the inertial regime we consider, we find that (a) the system is more predictable when it is in the zonal regime, and that (b) the horizon of predictability is far too short compared to characteristic time scales associated with processes that lead to regime transitions, thus precluding the possibility of predicting such transitions. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The half-light radii range from 1 to 20 kpc, with a median of 3 kpc. We compared r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fits to r_{1/2} derived using other profiles. In particular, we fit Sersic r^{1/n}-laws and superpositions of r^{1/4}-law bulges with exponential disks. The r_{1/2} derived from the best-fit Sersic profiles varied with respect to r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fits by 1% in the median, but with a standard deviation of more than 40%. For the bulge-plus-disk fits, the derived r_{1/2} were offset from r_e of the r^{1/4}-law fits by 10% in the mean, also with a standard deviation of more than 40%. By comparing the Sersic r_{1/2} with those derived from the bulge-plus-disk fitting, that scatter is also large, at 30%. We conclude that r_{1/2} is generally measured with a typical accuracy of 30-40%. The large uncertainties in r_{1/2} do not impact the fundamental plane analysis because the combination r<I>^{0.76}, which enters the fundamental plane, is extremely stable. The rms scatter in r<I>^{0.76} is less than 3%, regardless of the form of the profile fit to the galaxies. We find that the median bulge fraction of the sample is 84% and that the few E+A galaxies in this sample have disks which make up about 10-35% of their total light. These results are consistent with residuals from fitting 2D r^{1/4}-law models directly to the galaxies, in which disk-like structures are revealed in about half of the sample.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is often used for the numerical solution of such problems. An alternative to MCMC is importance sampling, which can exhibit near perfect scaling with the number of cores on high performance computing systems because samples are drawn independently. However, finding a suitable proposal distribution is a challenging task. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed over the past years that take an iterative approach to constructing a proposal distribution. We investigate the applicability of such algorithms by applying them to two realistic and challenging test problems, one in subsurface flow, and one in combustion modeling.

      "Inserting test sample 911  Gas behavior in systems at microscale has been receiving significant attention from researchers in the last two decades [1-4]. Today, there is an enhanced emphasis on developing new experimental techniques to capture the local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. The main underlying reason behind this focus is the interesting physics exhibited by gases at these rarefied conditions, especially in the transition regime. There is the onset of local thermodynamic disequilibrium, which manifests as velocity slip and temperature jump [1-4] at the wall. However, there is limited experimental evidence on understanding these aforementioned phenomena. With the advances in experimental facilities, it is today possible, at least in principle, to map the local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. Molecular tagging approach is one such technique which has shown the potential to map the temperature profile in low pressure conditions [5]. In molecular tagging approach, a very small percentage of tracer molecules are introduced into the gas of interest, referred as carrier gas. In gas flow studies, the typical tracers employed are acetone and biacetyl. These tracer molecules, assumed to be in equilibrium with the carrier gas, are excited with a source of energy at a specific wavelength, typically a laser. The excited molecules are unstable and tend to de-excite in a radiative and non-radiative manner, which is manifested as fluorescence and phosphorescence. Following the deformation with time of a tagged line permits to obtain the flow velocity. In addition, the dependence of the phosphorescence and fluorescence intensity to the gas temperature could also allow to use this technique for local temperature measurements. The objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup capable of simultaneously mapping the wall and fluid near-wall temperatures with the final goal to measure temperature jump at the wall when rarefied conditions are reached.

      "Inserting test sample 917  The correlation between geomagnetic activity and the sunspot number in the 11-year solar cycle exhibits long-term variations due to the varying time lag between the sunspot-related and non-sunspot related geomagnetic activity, and the varying relative amplitude of the respective geomagnetic activity peaks. As the sunspot-related and non-sunspot related geomagnetic activity are caused by different solar agents, related to the solar toroidal and poloidal fields, respectively, we use their variations to derive the parameters of the solar dynamo transforming the poloidal field into toroidal field and back. We find that in the last 12 cycles the solar surface meridional circulation varied between 5 and 20 m/s (averaged over latitude and over the sunspot cycle), the deep circulation varied between 2.5 and 5.5 m/s, and the diffusivity in the whole of the convection zone was ~10**8 m2/s. In the last 12 cycles solar dynamo has been operating in moderately diffusion dominated regime in the bulk of the convection zone. This means that a part of the poloidal field generated at the surface is advected by the meridional circulation all the way to the poles, down to the tachocline and equatorward to sunspot latitudes, while another part is diffused directly to the tachocline at midlatitudes, \"short-circuiting\" the meridional circulation. The sunspot maximum is the superposition of the two surges of toroidal field generated by these two parts of the poloidal field, which is the explanation of the double peaks and the Gnevyshev gap in sunspot maximum. Near the tachocline, dynamo has been operating in diffusion dominated regime in which diffusion is more important than advection, so with increasing speed of the deep circulation the time for diffusive decay of the poloidal field decreases, and more toroidal field is generated leading to a higher sunspot maximum. During the Maunder minimum the dynamo was operating in advection dominated regime near the tachocline, with the transition from diffusion dominated to advection dominated regime caused by a sharp drop in the surface meridional circulation which is in general the most important factor modulating the amplitude of the sunspot cycle. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Most of the UV radiation in massive galaxies is absorbed by the dust, its escape fraction f_esc is low, increasing slowly with time. Galaxies in the average region have less dust, and agree with the observed UV LF. The LF of the overdense region is substantially higher, and contains much brighter galaxies.

      "Inserting test sample 929  The physics of the coolest phases in the hot Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) of clusters of galaxies is yet to be fully unveiled. X-ray cavities blown by the central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) contain enough energy to heat the surrounding gas and stop cooling, but locally blobs or filaments of gas appear to be able to cool to low temperatures of 10^4 K. In X-rays, however, gas with temperatures lower than 0.5 keV is not observed. Using a deep XMM-Newton observation of the cluster of galaxies Abell 2052, we derive 2D maps of the temperature, entropy, and iron abundance in the core region. About 130 kpc South-West of the central galaxy, we discover a discontinuity in the surface brightness of the hot gas which is consistent with a cold front. Interestingly, the iron abundance jumps from ~0.75 to ~0.5 across the front. In a smaller region to the North-West of the central galaxy we find a relatively high contribution of cool 0.5 keV gas, but no X-ray emitting gas is detected below that temperature. However, the region appears to be associated with much cooler H-alpha filaments in the optical waveband. The elliptical shape of the cold front in the SW of the cluster suggests that the front is caused by sloshing of the hot gas in the clusters gravitational potential. This effect is probably an important mechanism to transport metals from the core region to the outer parts of the cluster. The smooth temperature profile across the sharp jump in the metalicity indicates the presence of heat conduction and the lack of mixing across the discontinuity. The cool blob of gas NW of the central galaxy was probably pushed away from the core and squeezed by the adjacent bubble, where it can cool efficiently and relatively undisturbed by the AGN. Shock induced mixing between the two phases may cause the 0.5 keV gas to cool non-radiatively and explain our non-detection of gas below 0.5 keV. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

LiDEER employing a broadband pump pulse results in a drastic improvement of the modulation depth.

      "Inserting test sample 963  Datasets in engineering applications are often limited and contaminated, mainly due to unavoidable measurement noise and signal distortion. Thus, using conventional data-driven approaches to build a reliable discriminative model, and further applying this identified surrogate to uncertainty analysis remains to be very challenging. A deep learning approach is presented to provide predictions based on limited and noisy data. To address noise perturbation, the Bayesian learning method that naturally facilitates an automatic updating mechanism is considered to quantify and propagate model uncertainties into predictive quantities. Specifically, hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is first adopted to describe model uncertainties, which allows the prior assumption to be less subjective, while also makes the proposed surrogate more robust. Next, the Bayesian inference is seamlessly integrated into the DL framework, which in turn supports probabilistic programming by yielding a probability distribution of the quantities of interest rather than their point estimates. Variational inference (VI) is implemented for the posterior distribution analysis where the intractable marginalization of the likelihood function over parameter space is framed in an optimization format, and stochastic gradient descent method is applied to solve this optimization problem. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain an unbiased estimator in the predictive phase of Bayesian inference, where the proposed Bayesian deep learning (BDL) scheme is able to offer confidence bounds for the output estimation by analyzing propagated uncertainties. The effectiveness of Bayesian shrinkage is demonstrated in improving predictive performance using contaminated data, and various examples are provided to illustrate concepts, methodologies, and algorithms of this proposed BDL modeling technique. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

These three indicators generally agree in velocity and direction, and are consistent with a simple picture in which the gas is stationary or slowly outflowing at a few hundred km/s from the embedded galaxies. The absence of stronger outflows is not a projection effect: the covering fraction for our sample is limited to <1/8 (13%). The outflow velocities exclude models in which star formation or AGN produce \"super\" or \"hyper\" winds of up to ~1000km/s. The Dv_Lya offsets here are smaller than typical of LBGs, but similar to those of compact LAEs. The latter suggests that outflow speed cannot be a dominant factor in driving extended Lya emission. For one Lya blob (CDFS-LAB14), whose Lya profile and metal absorption line offsets suggest no significant bulk motion, we use a simple radiative transfer model to make the first column density measurement of gas in an embedded galaxy, finding it consistent with a DLA system. Overall, the absence of clear inflow signatures suggests that the channeling of gravitational cooling radiation into Lya is not significant over the radii probed here.

      "Inserting test sample 983  The task of object viewpoint estimation has been a challenge since the early days of computer vision. To estimate the viewpoint (or pose) of an object, people have mostly looked at object intrinsic features, such as shape or appearance. Surprisingly, informative features provided by other, extrinsic elements in the scene, have so far mostly been ignored. At the same time, contextual cues have been proven to be of great benefit for related tasks such as object detection or action recognition. In this paper, we explore how information from other objects in the scene can be exploited for viewpoint estimation. In particular, we look at object configurations by following a relational neighbor-based approach for reasoning about object relations. We show that, starting from noisy object detections and viewpoint estimates, exploiting the estimated viewpoint and location of other objects in the scene can lead to improved object viewpoint predictions. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that object configurations can indeed be used as a complementary cue to appearance-based viewpoint estimation. Our analysis reveals that the proposed context-based method can improve object viewpoint estimation by reducing specific types of viewpoint estimation errors commonly made by methods that only consider local information. Moreover, considering contextual information produces superior performance in scenes where a high number of object instances occur.

Our method is based on computing the relationships between the object and its context, which includes the background, other objects, and their respective viewpoints. We model this relationship using a graph-like structure, where each node represents an object and each edge represents a relationship between them. By applying a scalable optimization algorithm on this graph, we jointly estimate the viewpoint of all the objects in the scene. We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets for viewpoint estimation and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed.

In this paper we present a numerical experiment where two time decaying isotropic fields of kinetic energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ initially match over a narrow region. Within this region the kinetic energy varies as a hyperbolic tangent. The following temporal evolution produces a shearless mixing. The anisotropy and intermittency of velocity and velocity derivative statistics is observed. In particular the asymptotic behavior in time and as a function of the energy ratio $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$ is discussed. This limit corresponds to the maximum observable turbulent energy gradient for a given $E_1$ and is obtained through the limit $E_2 \\to 0$. A field with $E_1/E_2 \\to \\infty$ represents a mixing which could be observed near a surface subject to a very small velocity gradient separating two turbulent fields, one of which is nearly quiescent. In this condition the turbulent penetration is maximum and reaches a value equal to 1.2 times the nominal mixing layer width.

We show that this criterion applies to flows in a variety of regimes, including homogeneous isotropic turbulence, wall-bounded turbulence, and rotating turbulence. Through numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, we demonstrate that the new criterion is able to capture the non-Gaussian behavior of turbulence statistics more accurately than previous methods.

However, the shear signal is very small and accurate measurement depends critically on our ability to understand how non-ideal instrumental effects affect astronomical images. WFIRST will fly a focal plane containing 18 Teledyne H4RG-10 near infrared detector arrays, which present different instrument calibration challenges from previous weak lensing observations. Previous work has shown that correlation functions of flat field images are effective tools for disentangling linear and non-linear inter-pixel capacitance (IPC) and the brighter-fatter effect (BFE). Here we present a Fourier-domain treatment of the flat field correlations, which allows us to expand the previous formalism to all orders in IPC, BFE, and classical non-linearity. We show that biases in simulated flat field analyses in Paper I are greatly reduced through the use of this formalism. We then apply this updated formalism to flat field data from three WFIRST flight candidate detectors, and explore the robustness to variations in the analysis. We find that the BFE is present in all three detectors, and that its contribution to the flat field correlations dominates over the non-linear IPC. The magnitude of the BFE is such that the effective area of a pixel is increased by $(3.54\\pm0.03)\\times 10^{-7}$ for every electron deposited in a neighboring pixel. We compare IPC maps from flat field autocorrelation measurements to those obtained from the single pixel reset method and find a median difference of 0.113%.

      "Once a spot forms, it survives for several million years, even after the total magnetic field has decayed significantly. We find that the dipole axis is not stationary with respect to the neutron star's surface and does not in general coincide with the location of the magnetic spot. This is due to non-axisymmetric instabilities of the toroidal field that displace the poloidal dipole axis at rates that may reach $0.4^{\\circ}$ per century. A misaligned poloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant displacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case. Finally we discuss the evolution of neutron stars with such magnetic fields on the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram and the observational implications. We find that neutron stars spend a very short time before they cross the Death-Line of the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, compared to their characteristic ages. Moreover, the maximum intensity of their surface magnetic field is substantially higher than the dipole component of the field. We argue that SGR 0418+5729 could be an example of this type of behaviour, having a weak dipole field, yet hosting a magnetic spot responsible for its magnetar behaviour.

Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram, highlighting the role of magnetic field, chemical potential, and superconducting gap on the topological properties of the system.

      "Inserting test sample 1011  The analysis of modulation schemes for the physical layer network-coded two way relaying scenario is presented which employs two phases: Multiple access (MA) phase and Broadcast (BC) phase. It was shown by Koike-Akino et. al. that adaptively changing the network coding map used at the relay according to the channel conditions greatly reduces the impact of multiple access interference which occurs at the relay during the MA phase. Depending on the signal set used at the end nodes, deep fades occur for a finite number of channel fade states referred as the singular fade states. The singular fade states fall into the following two classes: The ones which are caused due to channel outage and whose harmful effect cannot be mitigated by adaptive network coding are referred as the \\textit{non-removable singular fade states}. The ones which occur due to the choice of the signal set and whose harmful effects can be removed by a proper choice of the adaptive network coding map are referred as the \\textit{removable} singular fade states. In this paper, we derive an upper bound on the average end-to-end Symbol Error Rate (SER), with and without adaptive network coding at the relay, for a Rician fading scenario. It is shown that without adaptive network coding, at high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), the contribution to the end-to-end SER comes from the following error events which fall as $\\text{SNR}^{-1}$: the error events associated with the removable singular fade states, the error events associated with the non-removable singular fade states and the error event during the BC phase. In contrast, for the adaptive network coding scheme, the error events associated with the removable singular fade states contributing to the average end-to-end SER fall as $\\text{SNR}^{-2}$ and as a result the adaptive network coding scheme provides a coding gain over the case when adaptive network coding is not used. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1023  This paper presents detailed analysis of large-scale peculiar motions derived from a sample of ~ 700 X-ray clusters and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data obtained with WMAP. We use the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (KSZ) effect combining it into a cumulative statistic which preserves the bulk motion component with the noise integrated down. Such statistic is the dipole of CMB temperature fluctuations evaluated over the pixels of the cluster catalog (Kashlinsky & Atrio-Barandela 2000). To remove the cosmological CMB fluctuations the maps are Wiener-filtered in each of the eight WMAP channels (Q, V, W) which have negligible foreground component. Our findings are as follows: The thermal SZ (TSZ) component of the clusters is described well by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile expected if the hot gas traces the dark matter in the cluster potential wells. Such gas has X-ray temperature decreasing rapidly towards the cluster outskirts, which we demonstrate results in the decrease of the TSZ component as the aperture is increased to encompass the cluster outskirts. We then detect a statistically significant dipole in the CMB pixels at cluster positions. Arising exclusively at the cluster pixels this dipole cannot originate from the foreground or instrument noise emissions and must be produced by the CMB photons which interacted with the hot intracluster gas via the SZ effect. The dipole remains as the monopole component, due to the TSZ effect, vanishes within the small statistical noise out to the maximal aperture where we still detect the TSZ component. We demonstrate with simulations that the mask and cross-talk effects are small for our catalog and contribute negligibly to the measurements. The measured dipole thus arises from the KSZ effect produced by the coherent large scale bulk flow motion. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1025  In the redshift range z = 0-1, the gamma ray burst (GRB) redshift distribution should increase rapidly because of increasing differential volume sizes and strong evolution in the star formation rate. This feature is not observed in the Swift redshift distribution and to account for this discrepancy, a dominant bias, independent of the Swift sensitivity, is required. Furthermore, despite rapid localization, about 40-50% of Swift and pre-Swift GRBs do not have a measured redshift. We employ a heuristic technique to extract this redshift bias using 66 GRBs localized by Swift with redshifts determined from absorption or emission spectroscopy. For the Swift and HETE+BeppoSAX redshift distributions, the best model fit to the bias in z < 1 implies that if GRB rate evolution follows the SFR, the bias cancels this rate increase. We find that the same bias is affecting both Swift and HETE+BeppoSAX measurements similarly in z < 1. Using a bias model constrained at a 98% KS probability, we find that 72% of GRBs in z < 2 will not have measurable redshifts and about 55% in z > 2. To achieve this high KS probability requires increasing the GRB rate density in small z compared to the high-z rate.

It routinely occurs in granular and porous media, can strongly alter such properties as adhesion, lubrication, friction and corrosion, and is important in many processes employed by microelectronics, pharmaceutical, food and other industries. The century-old Kelvin equation is commonly used to describe condensation phenomena and shown to hold well for liquid menisci with diameters as small as several nm. For even smaller capillaries that are involved in condensation under ambient humidity and, hence, of particular practical interest, the Kelvin equation is expected to break down, because the required confinement becomes comparable to the size of water molecules. Here we take advantage of van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals to create atomic-scale capillaries and study condensation inside. Our smallest capillaries are less than 4 angstroms in height and can accommodate just a monolayer of water. Surprisingly, even at this scale, the macroscopic Kelvin equation using the characteristics of bulk water is found to describe accurately the condensation transition in strongly hydrophilic (mica) capillaries and remains qualitatively valid for weakly hydrophilic (graphene) ones. We show that this agreement is somewhat fortuitous and can be attributed to elastic deformation of capillary walls, which suppresses giant oscillatory behavior expected due to commensurability between atomic-scale confinement and water molecules.

      "Inserting test sample 1101  Observations of hot Jupiters around solar-type stars with very short orbital periods (~day) suggest that tidal dissipation in such stars is not too efficient so that these planets can survive against rapid orbital decay. This is consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of planet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from stellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin effects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such systems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also show that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital axes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may be explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation in the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the survival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type parent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing the damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing orbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential contains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency (in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves in the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves then leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By contrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since the tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We derive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries, taking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different tidal forcing components. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this context, the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) is a powerful tool to understand how environment relates to galaxy mass assembly and the quenching of star-formation. In this work, we make use of the high-precision photometric redshifts of the UltraVISTA Survey to study the GSMF in different environments up to $z \\sim 3$, on physical scales from 0.3 to 2 Mpc, down to masses of $M \\sim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$. We witness the appearance of environmental signatures for both quiescent and star-forming galaxies. We find that the shape of the GSMF of quiescent galaxies is different in high- and low-density environments up to $z \\sim 2$ with the high-mass end ($M \\gtrsim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$) being enhanced in high-density environments. On the contrary, for star-forming galaxies a difference between the GSMF in high- and low density environments is present for masses $M \\lesssim 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. Star-forming galaxies in this mass range appear to be more frequent in low-density environments up to $z < 1.5$. Differences in the shape of the GSMF are not visible anymore at $z > 2$. Our results, in terms of general trends in the shape of the GSMF, are in agreement with a scenario in which galaxies are quenched when they enter hot gas-dominated massive haloes which are preferentially in high-density environments. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The present paper extends these equations to include models with variable Newton parameter and variable cosmological term, motivated by the nonperturbative renormalization program for quantum gravity based upon the Einstein-Hilbert action. We focus on the Brans-Dicke form of the renormalization-group improved action functional. The coupling between backreaction and spatially averaged three-dimensional scalar curvature is found to survive, and a variable-G cosmic quintet is found to emerge. Interestingly, under suitable assumptions, an approximate solution can be found where the early universe tends to a FLRW model, while keeping track of the original inhomogeneities through three effective fluids.

      "Inserting test sample 1201  The available data for E2 transition strengths in the region between neutron-deficient Hf and Pt isotopes are far from complete. More and precise data are needed to enhance the picture of structure evolution in this region and to test state-of-the-art nuclear models. In a simple model, the maximum collectivity is expected at the middle of the major shell. However, for actual nuclei, this picture may no longer be the case, and one should use a more realistic nuclear-structure model. We address this point by studying the spectroscopy of Hf. We remeasure the 2^+_1 half-lives of 172,174,176Hf, for which there is some disagreement in the literature. The main goal is to measure, for the first time, the half-lives of higher-lying states of the rotational band. The new results are compared to a theoretical calculation for absolute transition strengths. The half-lives were measured using \\gamma-\\gamma and conversion-electron-\\gamma delayed coincidences with the fast timing method. For the determination of half-lives in the picosecond region, the generalized centroid difference method was applied. For the theoretical calculation of the spectroscopic properties, the interacting boson model is employed, whose Hamiltonian is determined based on microscopic energy-density functional calculations. The measured 2^+_1 half-lives disagree with results from earlier \\gamma-\\gamma fast timing measurements, but are in agreement with data from Coulomb excitation experiments and other methods. Half-lives of the 4^+_1 and 6^+_1 states were measured, as well as a lower limit for the 8^+_1 states. We show the importance of the mass-dependence of effective boson charge in the description of E2 transition rates in chains of nuclei.

Our results reveal that the E2 transition strength increases with deformation in $^{172}$Hf up to a critical point, beyond which it decreases with further deformation. A similar trend is observed in $^{174}$Hf, but with a smaller increase in the transition strength. In $^{176}$Hf, the E2 transition strength increases with deformation up to the highest studied values. We compare our new data with the existing data in this mass region and find good agreement. Our results suggest that the evolution of the E2 transition strength in deformed hafnium isotopes is highly sensitive to their deformation and the location of the neutron number.

In this paper, we explore the behavior of the Boolean model in the Shannon regime, where the number of inputs and outputs is large.

The first threshold determines the point at which the system becomes unstable and unpredictable, leading to exponential growth in the number of steady states. The second threshold marks the transition from the regime of high correlation to low correlation among the inputs and outputs, resulting in a change in the system's behavior. The third threshold corresponds to the number of bits needed to represent a steady state, beyond which the model's space complexity becomes impractical.

Moreover, in the case of developed countries, recently has been proven that inequality is closely related to all negative phenomena affecting society. So far, Econophysics papers tried to analyse income and wealth distribution by employing distributions such as Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein, Maxwell-Boltzmann, lognormal (Gibrat), and exponential. Generally, distributions describe mostly income and less wealth distribution for low and middle income segment of population, which accounts about 90% of the population. Our approach is based on a totally new distribution, not used so far in the literature regarding income and wealth distribution. Using cumulative distribution method, we find that polynomial functions, regardless of their degree (first, second, or higher), can describe with very high accuracy both income and wealth distribution.

However, only a subset of information is available, due to projective nature of imaging in the beam direction. Correspondingly, the analysis often relies on the postulated known form of macroscopic Landau-Ginzburg energy, and some predefined relationship between experimentally determined atomic coordinates and the order parameter field. Here, we propose an approach for exploring the structure of ferroics using reduced order parameter models constructed based on experimental data only. We develop a four sublattices model (FSM) for the analytical description of A-cation displacement in (anti)ferroelectric-antiferrodistortive perovskites of ABO3-type.

Increasing observational evidence suggests that planet formation occurs in less than 1 Myr. This motivates the need for spatially resolved spectral observations of Class I disks, as carried out by the ALMA chemical survey of Disk-Outflow sources in Taurus (ALMA-DOT). In the context of ALMA-DOT, we observe the edge-on disk around the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247 (the butterfly star) in the 1.3mm continuum and five molecular lines. We report the first tentative detection of methanol (CH$_3$OH) in a Class I disk and resolve, for the first time, the vertical structure of a disk with multiple molecular tracers. The bulk of the emission in the CO 2-1, CS 5-4, and o-H$_2$CO 3(1,2)-2(1,1) lines originates from the warm molecular layer, with the line intensity peaking at increasing disk heights, $z$, for increasing radial distances, $r$. Molecular emission is vertically stratified, with CO observed at larger disk heights (aperture $z/r\\sim0.41-0.45$) compared to both CS and H$_2$CO, which are nearly cospatial ($z/r\\sim0.21-0.28$). In the outer midplane, the line emission decreases due to molecular freeze-out onto dust grains (freeze-out layer) by a factor of >100 (CO) and 15 (CS). The H$_2$CO emission decreases by a factor of only about 2, which is possibly due to H$_2$CO formation on icy grains, followed by a nonthermal release into the gas phase. The inferred [CH$_3$OH]/[H$_2$CO] abundance ratio is 0.5-0.6, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than for Class 0 hot corinos, and a factor ~2.5 lower than the only other value inferred for a protoplanetary disk (in TW Hya, 1.3-1.7).

We find that the abundance ratios of various molecular species show a clear dependence on vertical height in the disk. Specifically, the CO and H$_2$CO emission is found to be more abundant towards the disk midplane, while the CS, CN, and CH$_3$OH emission is more abundant in higher regions of the disk. This vertical stratification may be due to changes in physical conditions across the disk, such as temperature and density, or it may be a consequence of gas-phase chemistry driven by UV irradiation from nearby stars. The high angular resolution of our ALMA observations enables us to map the vertical distribution of these complex molecules in fine detail, and our results suggest that the molecular content of protoplanetary disks may be dominated by vertical structures that depend on the height above the disk midplane. Our study provides a solid foundation for future high-resolution studies of disk-outflow interactions in the Taurus region, and for future efforts to understand how molecular abundances evolve over time in protoplanetary disks.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for approximating the sparsest cut problem in graphs with non-uniform degree distributions.\n",

This matches the best-known approximation ratio for the sparsest cut problem, and in fact improves upon it in some cases.\n",

The galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated Lyman-Break technique on the full two-year WFC3/IR and ACS data available over the HUDF09 (~29.4 AB mag, 5 sigma), two nearby HUDF09 fields (~29 AB mag, 14 arcmin) and the wider area ERS (~27.5 AB mag) ~40 arcmin**2). The application of strict optical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low (just ~7% in the HUDF). This very low value includes a full assessment of the contamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, AGN, spurious sources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., SNe). From careful modelling of the selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosity functions for galaxies at z~7 and z~8 to <-18 AB mag. The faint-end slopes alpha at z~7 and z~8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 and alpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively.

In this paper, we suggest an inexpensive and easy to implement parameter estimation technique that uses a heteroscedastic Bayesian Neural Network trained using anchored ensembling. The heteroscedastic aleatoric error of the network models the irreducible uncertainty due to parameter degeneracies in our inverse problem, while the epistemic uncertainty of the Bayesian model captures uncertainties which may arise from an input observation's out-of-distribution nature. We use this tool to perform real-time parameter inference in a 6 parameter G-equation model of a ducted, premixed flame from observations of acoustically excited flames. We train our networks on a library of 2.1 million simulated flame videos. Results on the test dataset of simulated flames show that the network recovers flame model parameters, with the correlation coefficient between predicted and true parameters ranging from 0.97 to 0.99, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. The trained neural networks are then used to infer model parameters from real videos of a premixed Bunsen flame captured using a high-speed camera in our lab. Re-simulation using inferred parameters shows excellent agreement between the real and simulated flames. Compared to Ensemble Kalman Filter-based tools that have been proposed for this problem in the combustion literature, our neural network ensemble achieves better data-efficiency and our sub-millisecond inference times represent a savings on computational costs by several orders of magnitude.

In recent years, machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem, with the aim of automatically learning auction designs from examples. In this paper, we review the recent literature on learning multi-item auctions, focusing on the use of sample-based methods, which learn by simulating auctions and observing their outcomes. We show how these methods can be used to effectively optimize a wide range of auction objectives, such as revenue, fairness, and social welfare.

Finally, we explore some directions for future research, including the use of reinforcement learning and the incorporation of causal reasoning into auction design.

We report new lucky imaging observations of this star with the VLT/NACO adaptive optics system in twelve narrow band filters covering the 1.0-4.0 microns wavelength range. These diffraction limited images reveal an extended circumstellar dust lane in front of the star, that exhibits a high opacity in the J band and becomes translucent in the H and K bands. In the L band, extended thermal emission from the dust is detected. We reproduce these observations using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer modeling of a dust disk with the RADMC-3D code. We also present new interferometric observations with the VLTI/VINCI and MIDI instruments. We measure in the K band an upper limit to the limb-darkened angular diameter of theta_LD = 17.9 +/- 1.6 mas, converting to a maximum linear radius of R = 123 +/- 14 Rsun. Considering the geometry of the extended K band emission in the NACO images, this upper limit is probably close to the actual angular diameter of the star. The position of L2 Pup in the Herzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that this star has a mass around 2 Msun and is probably experiencing an early stage of the asymptotic giant branch. We do not detect any stellar companion of L2 Pup in our adaptive optics and interferometric observations, and we attribute its apparent astrometric wobble in the Hipparcos data to variable lighting effects on its circumstellar material. We however do not exclude the presence of a binary companion, as the large loop structure extending to more than 10 AU to the North-East of the disk in our L band images may be the result of interaction between the stellar wind of L2 Pup and a hidden secondary object.

      "Inserting test sample 1253  Highlights in a sport video are usually referred as actions that stimulate excitement or attract attention of the audience. A big effort is spent in designing techniques which find automatically highlights, in order to automatize the otherwise manual editing process. Most of the state-of-the-art approaches try to solve the problem by training a classifier using the information extracted on the tv-like framing of players playing on the game pitch, learning to detect game actions which are labeled by human observers according to their perception of highlight. Obviously, this is a long and expensive work. In this paper, we reverse the paradigm: instead of looking at the gameplay, inferring what could be exciting for the audience, we directly analyze the audience behavior, which we assume is triggered by events happening during the game. We apply deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) to extract visual features from cropped video recordings of the supporters that are attending the event. Outputs of the crops belonging to the same frame are then accumulated to produce a value indicating the Highlight Likelihood (HL) which is then used to discriminate between positive (i.e. when a highlight occurs) and negative samples (i.e. standard play or time-outs). Experimental results on a public dataset of ice-hockey matches demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and promote further research in this new exciting direction. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The proposed DCNN architecture integrates multiple convolutional layers with max pooling and non-linear activation functions, followed by several fully connected layers for classification. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a publicly available soccer video dataset and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for indirect match highlights detection. To gain insight into the learned features, we provide a comprehensive analysis of feature maps and demonstrate that our DCNN architecture can efficiently capture local motion and texture patterns in soccer videos. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect indirect match highlights in challenging scenarios, such as occlusion, camera motion, and cluttered backgrounds.

      "Inserting test sample 1255  Unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms support the existence of three gamma-ray burst classes; Class I (long, large fluence bursts of intermediate spectral hardness), Class II (short, small fluence, hard bursts), and Class III (soft bursts of intermediate durations and fluences). The algorithms surprisingly assign larger membership to Class III than to either of the other two classes. A known systematic bias has been previously used to explain the existence of Class III in terms of Class I; this bias allows the fluences and durations of some bursts to be underestimated (Hakkila et al., ApJ 538, 165, 2000). We show that this bias primarily affects only the longest bursts and cannot explain the bulk of the Class III properties. We resolve the question of Class III existence by demonstrating how samples obtained using standard trigger mechanisms fail to preserve the duration characteristics of small peak flux bursts. Sample incompleteness is thus primarily responsible for the existence of Class III. In order to avoid this incompleteness, we show how a new dual timescale peak flux can be defined in terms of peak flux and fluence.\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1261  Images obtained by the Cassini spacecraft between 2012 and 2015 reveal a periodic brightness variation in a region of Saturn's D ring that previously appeared to be rather featureless. Furthermore, the intensity and radial wavenumber of this pattern have decreased steadily with time since it was first observed. Based on analogies with similar structures elsewhere in the D ring, we propose that this structure was created by some event that disturbed the orbital motions of the ring particles, giving them finite orbital eccentricities and initially aligned pericenters. Differential orbital precession then transformed this structure into a spiral pattern in the ring's optical depth that became increasingly tightly wound over time. The observed trends in the pattern's radial wavenumber are roughly consistent with this basic model, and also indicate that the ring-disturbing event occurred in early December 2011. Similar events in 1979 may have generated the periodic patterns seen in this same region by the Voyager spacecraft. The 2011 event could have been caused by debris striking the rings, or by a disturbance in the planet's electromagnetic environment. The rapid reduction in the intensity of the brightness variations over the course of just a few years indicates that some process is either damping orbital eccentricities in this region or causing the orbital pericenters of particles with the same semi-major axis to become misaligned. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

To address this issue, continual learning has been developed to learn new tasks sequentially and perform knowledge transfer from the old tasks to the new ones without forgetting. While recent structure-based learning methods show the capability of alleviating the forgetting problem, these methods start from a redundant full-size network and require a complex learning process to gradually grow-and-prune or search the network structure for each task, which is inefficient. To address this problem and enable efficient network expansion for new tasks, we first develop a learnable sparse growth method eliminating the additional pruning/searching step in previous structure-based methods. Building on this learnable sparse growth method, we then propose GROWN, a novel end-to-end continual learning framework to dynamically grow the model only when necessary. Different from all previous structure-based methods, GROWN starts from a small seed network, instead of a full-sized one. We validate GROWN on multiple datasets against state-of-the-art methods, which shows superior performance in both accuracy and model size.

We find that an empty cavity ~25 AU in radius is inconsistent with the excess emission observed at 12, 22, and 24 micron. Instead, the mid-IR excess can be modeled by either a narrow, optically thick ring at ~10 AU or an optically thin region extending from ~7 AU to ~25 AU.

      "In this paper, first we discuss that these two modes can be associated with the category theoretic duality (adjunction) and derive a natural network structure (a path notion) for each mode by appealing to the category theoretic universality. The path notion corresponding to the static mode is just the usual directed path. The path notion for the dynamic mode is called lateral path which is the alternating path considered on the set of arcs. Their general functionalities in a network are transport and coherence, respectively. Second, we introduce a betweenness centrality of arcs for each mode and see how the two modes are embedded in various real biological network data. We find that there is a trade-off relationship between the two centralities: if the value of one is large then the value of the other is small. This can be seen as a kind of division of labor in a network into transport on the network and coherence of the network. Finally, we propose an optimization model of networks based on a quality function involving intensities of the two modes in order to see how networks with the above trade-off relationship can emerge through evolution. We show that the trade-off relationship can be observed in the evolved networks only when the dynamic mode is dominant in the quality function by numerical simulations.

In this paper, we present and analyze admission data of students from different groups entering a math PhD program at a southern California university. We observe that some factors correlate with success in the PhD program (defined as obtaining a PhD degree within a time-limit). According to our analysis, GRE scores correlate with success, but interestingly, the verbal part of the GRE score has a higher predictive power compared to the quantitative part. Further, we observe that undergraduate student GPA does not correlate with success (there is even a slight negative slope in the relationship between GPA and the probability of success). This counterintuitive observation is explained once undergraduate institutions are separated by tiers: students from \"higher tiers\" have undergone a more rigorous training program; they on average have a slightly lower GPA but run a slightly higher probability to succeed. Finally, a gender gap is observed in the probability to succeed with female students having a lower probability to finish with a PhD despite the same undergraduate performance, compared to males.

Success in the program was determined by grade point average (GPA) and completion rates. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of success.

      "Inserting test sample 1293  The literature on \"mechanism design from samples,\" which has flourished in recent years at the interface of economics and computer science, offers a bridge between the classic computer-science approach of worst-case analysis (corresponding to \"no samples\") and the classic economic approach of average-case analysis for a given Bayesian prior (conceptually corresponding to the number of samples tending to infinity). Nonetheless, the two directions studied so far are two extreme and almost diametrically opposed directions: that of asymptotic results where the number of samples grows large, and that where only a single sample is available. In this paper, we take a first step toward understanding the middle ground that bridges these two approaches: that of a fixed number of samples greater than one. In a variety of contexts, we ask what is possibly the most fundamental question in this direction: \"are two samples really better than one sample?\". We present a few surprising negative results, and complement them with our main result: showing that the worst-case, over all regular distributions, expected-revenue guarantee of the Empirical Revenue Maximization algorithm given two samples is greater than that of this algorithm given one sample.

We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the sample complexity and estimation error bounds of empirical maximization under a general class of revenue functions, which includes a number of widely used functions such as the generalized second-price and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auctions. Our results reveal that the benefit of using two samples instead of one can be situation-dependent, and essentially hinges on the degree of dependence and correlation between the two samples. In particular, we find that in many cases using two independent samples could potentially lead to more accurate estimation and better revenue performance guarantees than using a single sample.

M. Kalita et al, Phys. Rev. E 93, 062503 (2016)]. The planar problem of magnetostriction in an MAE with soft magnetic inclusions in the form of a thin disk (platelet) having the magnetic anisotropy in the plane of this disk is solved analytically. An external magnetic field acts with torques on magnetic filler particles, creates mechanical stresses in the vicinity of inclusions, induces shear strain and increases the effective shear modulus of these composite materials. It is shown that the largest effect of the magnetic field on the effective shear modulus should be expected in MAEs with soft elastomer matrices, where the shear modulus of the matrix is less than the magnetic anisotropy constant of inclusions. It is derived that the effective shear modulus is non-linearly dependent on the external magnetic field and approaches the saturation value in magnetic fields exceeding the field of particle anisotropy. It is shown that model calculations of the effective shear modulus correspond to a phenomenological definition of effective elastic moduli and magnetoelastic coupling constants. Obtained theoretical results compare well with known experimental data. Determination of effective elastic coefficients in MAEs and their dependence on magnetic field is discussed.

As far as we know, no authors have yet studied the tensile behaviour of compact bone including failure under dynamic loadings (1m/s). The originality of this study comes from not only the analysis of compact bone failure under dynamic loadings, the results of which are compared to those obtained under quasi static loadings but also the development of a statistical model. We developed a protocol using three different devices. Firstly, an X-ray scanner to analyse bone density, secondly, a common tensile device to perform quasi static experiments and thirdly, a special device based upon a hydraulic cylinder to perform dynamic tests. For all the tests, we used the same sample shape which took into account the brittleness of the compact bone. We first performed relaxation and hysteresis tests followed by tensile tests up to failure. Viscous and plastic effects were not relevant to the compact bone behaviour so its behaviour was considered elastic and brittle. The bovine compact bone was three to four times more brittle under a dynamic load than under a quasi static one. Numerically, a statistical model, based upon the Weibull theory is used to predict the failure stress in compact bone. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 1310  This study investigates the failure behavior of compact bone under two different loading rates, using both experimental and modeling approaches. The first loading rate is the quasi-static compression, while the second rate is the dynamic compression. The results indicate that the quasi-static compression leads to a localized shear deformation and produces a distinct fracture pattern, while the dynamic compression leads to a diffuse damage pattern and a more complex fracture pattern. Moreover, the stress-strain response of compact bone under quasi-static and dynamic compression has been characterized using experimental data. The proposed numerical model captures the observed biomechanical response and is validated using the experimental data. The results of this study provide insights into the understanding of the mechanisms of bone fracture under different loading conditions. This research has significant implications in the medical field, such as understanding the cause and prevention of bone fractures in aging or diseased individuals, or designing safer implants for patients with bone disorders. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The Han and Kobayashi (HK) scheme provides the best known inner bound. The rate difference between the best known lower and upper bounds on the sum capacity remains as large as 1 bit per channel use especially around $g^2=P^{-1/3}$, where $P$ is the symmetric power constraint and $g$ is the symmetric real cross-channel coefficient. In this paper, we pay attention to the \\emph{moderate interference regime} where $g^2\\in (\\max(0.086, P^{-1/3}),1)$. We propose a new upper-bounding technique that utilizes noisy observation of interfering signals as genie signals and applies time sharing to the genie signals at the receivers. A conditional version of the worst additive noise lemma is also introduced to derive new capacity bounds. The resulting upper (outer) bounds on the sum capacity (capacity region) are shown to be tighter than the existing bounds in a certain range of the moderate interference regime. Using the new upper bounds and the HK lower bound, we show that $R_\\text{sym}^*=\\frac{1}{2}\\log \\big(|g|P+|g|^{-1}(P+1)\\big)$ characterizes the capacity of the symmetric real GIC to within $0.104$ bit per channel use in the moderate interference regime at any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

      "Inserting test sample 1317  Clear, persuasive arguments are brought forward to motivate the need for highly precise measurements of the electron/muon orbital g, i.e. gL. First, we briefly review results obtained using an extended Dirac equation, which conclusively showed that, as a consequence of quantum relativistic corrections arising from the time-dependence of the rest-energy, the electron gyromagnetic factors are corrected. It is next demonstrated, using the data of Kusch & Foley on the measurement of deltaS minus 2 deltaL together with the modern precise measurements of the electron deltaS where deltaS identically equal to gS minus 2, that deltaL may be a small, non-zero quantity, where we have assumed Russel-Saunders LS coupling and proposed, along with Kusch and Foley, that gS = 2 plus deltaS and gS = 1 plus deltaL. Therefore, there is probable evidence from experimental data that gS is not exactly equal to 1; the expectation that quantum effects will significantly modify the classical value of the orbital g is therefore reasonable. Finally, we show that if, as suggested by the results obtained from the modified Dirac theory, deltaS and deltaL depend linearly on a dimensionless parameter DELTA such that the gyromagnetic factors are considered corrected as follows; gS = 2 plus 2 DELTA and gL = 1 minus DELTA, then the Kusch-Foley data implies that the correction DELTA approximately equals 1.0 times 10-3 . Modern, high precision measurements of the electron and muon orbital gL are therefore required, in order to properly determine by experiments the true value of gL minus 1, perhaps to about one part in a trillion as was recently done for gS minus 2. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

MUSE is a unique experiment that allows for non-destructive measurements of the magnetic moment of the muon and the electron. Our results show agreement with the QED calculations, verifying their theoretical predictions to unparalleled accuracy. We obtain a precision of 0.28 parts per million for the electron and 0.23 parts per million for the muon, the most precise measurements to date. Our experimental technique employs the principle of spin precession in a magnetic field to determine the gyromagnetic factors. By subjecting the particles to a magnetic field, we can measure their motion and thereby calculate the strength of their magnetic field.

      "Inserting test sample 1321  This paper is concerned with particle filtering for $\\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models. The $\\alpha$-stable distribution provides a flexible framework for modeling asymmetry and heavy tails, which is useful when modeling financial returns. An issue with this distributional assumption is the lack of a closed form for the probability density function. To estimate the volatility of financial returns in this setting, we develop a novel auxiliary particle filter. The algorithm we develop can be easily applied to any hidden Markov model for which the likelihood function is intractable or computationally expensive. The approximate target distribution of our auxiliary filter is based on the idea of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). ABC methods allow for inference on posterior quantities in situations when the likelihood of the underlying model is not available in closed form, but simulating samples from it is possible. The ABC auxiliary particle filter (ABC-APF) that we propose provides not only a good alternative to state estimation in stochastic volatility models, but it also improves on the existing ABC literature. It allows for more flexibility in state estimation while improving on the accuracy through better proposal distributions in cases when the optimal importance density of the filter is unavailable in closed form.

      "Inserting test sample 1331  Boundary layers in space and astrophysical plasmas are the location of complex dynamics where different mechanisms coexist and compete eventually leading to plasma mixing. In this work, we present fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell simulations of different boundary layers characterized by the following main ingredients: a velocity shear, a density gradient and a magnetic gradient localized at the same position. In particular, the presence of a density gradient drives the development of the lower hybrid drift instability (LHDI), which competes with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in the development of the boundary layer. Depending on the density gradient, the LHDI can even dominate the dynamics of the layer. Because these two instabilities grow on different spatial and temporal scales, when the LHDI develops faster than the KHI an inverse cascade is generated, at least in 2D. This inverse cascade, starting at the LHDI kinetic scales, generates structures at scale lengths at which the KHI would typically develop. When that is the case, those structures can suppress the KHI itself because they significantly affect the underlying velocity shear gradient. We conclude that depending on the density gradient, the velocity jump and the width of the boundary layer, the LHDI in its nonlinear phase can become the primary instability for plasma mixing.

The data were collected from the LEP accelerator experiment at CERN. The search for R-parity violation is motivated by the fact that it could explain certain phenomena in particle physics, such as the observed neutrino oscillations. The analysis focused on events with at least one charged lepton and large missing transverse momentum. The expected background from standard model processes was estimated and compared with the observed data, revealing no significant excess. Exclusion limits on the Ubar Dbar Dbar coupling were derived, and regions of the parameter space were constrained. The results of this study provide important insights into the nature of R-parity violation, and could guide future research into its potential impact on the fundamental nature of matter and energy.

We also compare the Hb and MgII profiles of 4 objects with models of photoionized accretion disks and find them to be in reasonable agreement. Double-peaked emitters stand out on the basis of the following properties: (1) unusually large contribution of starlight to the optical continuum around Ha, (2) unusually large equivalent widths of low-ionization lines ([OI] and [SII]), (3) unusually large [OI]/[OIII] ratios, and (4) Balmer lines on average twice as broad as in other radio-loud AGNs.

      "Inserting test sample 1363  Quantifying entanglement is a work in progress which is important for the active field of quantum information and computation. A measure of bipartite entanglement is proposed here, named entanglement coherence, which is essentially the normalized coherence of the entangled state in its Schmidt basis. Its value is 1 for maximally entangled states, and 0 for separable states, irrespective of the dimensionality of the Hilbert space. So a maximally entangled state is also the one which is maximally coherent in its Schmidt basis. Quantum entanglement and quantum coherence are thus intimately connected. Additionally it is shown that the entanglement coherence is closely connected to the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the reduced density operator of one of the subsystems, in an interesting way. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1365  Energy beamforming (EB) is a key technique for achieving efficient radio-frequency (RF) transmission enabled wireless energy transfer (WET). By optimally designing the waveforms from multiple energy transmitters (ETs) over the wireless channels, they are constructively combined at the energy receiver (ER) to achieve an EB gain that scales with the number of ETs. However, the optimal design of transmit waveforms requires accurate channel state information (CSI) at the ETs, which is challenging to obtain in practical WET systems. In this paper, we propose a new channel training scheme to achieve optimal EB gain in a distributed WET system, where multiple separated ETs adjust their transmit phases to collaboratively send power to a single ER in an iterative manner, based on one-bit feedback from the ER per training interval which indicates the increase/decrease of the received power level from one particular ET over two preassigned transmit phases. The proposed EB algorithm can be efficiently implemented in practical WET systems even with a large number of distributed ETs, and is analytically shown to converge quickly to the optimal EB design as the number of feedback intervals per ET increases.\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1391  To develop, calibrate and/or validate continuum models from experimental or numerical data, micro-macro transition methods are required. These methods are used to obtain the continuum fields (such as density, momentum, stress) from the discrete data (positions, velocities, forces). This is especially challenging for non-uniform and dynamic situations in the presence of multiple components. Here, we present a general method to perform this micro-macro transition, but for simplicity we restrict our attention to two-component scenarios, e.g. particulate mixtures containing two types of particles. We present an extension to the micro-macro transition method, called \\emph{coarse-graining}, for unsteady two-component flows. By construction, this novel averaging method is advantageous, e.g. when compared to binning methods, because the obtained macroscopic fields are consistent with the continuum equations of mass, momentum, and energy balance. Additionally, boundary interaction forces can be taken into account in a self-consistent way and thus allow for the construction of continuous stress fields even within one particle radius of the boundaries. Similarly, stress and drag forces can also be determined for individual constituents of a multi-component mixture, which is essential for several continuum applications, \\textit{e.g.} mixture theory segregation models. Moreover, the method does not require ensemble-averaging and thus can be efficiently exploited to investigate static, steady, and time-dependent flows. The method presented in this paper is valid for any discrete data, \\textit{e.g.} particle simulations, molecular dynamics, experimental data, etc. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 1392  The continuum field theory plays a vital role in the theoretical modeling of various physical phenomena by describing continuous variables such as temperature and density. However, when it comes to granular materials, discrete methods are frequently used to model the evolution of systems consisting of individual particles, which is fundamentally different from continuum fields. In this research work, we present an extension of the continuum field approach to analyze bidisperse systems, i.e., systems made of two different particle sizes. This extension is achieved by introducing a set of equations that describe the cross-coupling terms between different particle sizes, enabling us to simulate bidisperse materials through the continuum framework. The validity and accuracy of this new model were verified through direct comparisons with available experimental data and discrete element simulations. We observed that the presented continuum model successfully reproduces key features of the observed dynamics and identifies the mechanisms responsible for bidispersity-induced segregation in granular materials. Our results demonstrate that the continuum framework can be extended to multi-component systems, providing a powerful tool in the analysis of complex materials. This extension of the continuum theory is expected to have broad applications in the modeling and design of industrial processes involving bidisperse granular materials. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

While most previous researches focus on optimizing the image processing algorithms to gain higher efficiency, our work dedicates to providing a general framework for those image processing algorithms, which can be implemented in parallel so as to achieve a boost in time efficiency without compromising the results performance along with the increasing image scale. The proposed ICP framework consists of two mechanisms, i.e. SICP (Static ICP) and DICP (Dynamic ICP). Specifically, SICP is aimed at processing the big image data pre-stored in the distributed system, while DICP is proposed for dynamic input. To accomplish SICP, two novel data representations named P-Image and Big-Image are designed to cooperate with MapReduce to achieve more optimized configuration and higher efficiency. DICP is implemented through a parallel processing procedure working with the traditional processing mechanism of the distributed system.

This paper proposes a machine learning predictive model for AD development without medical imaging and with fewer clinical visits and tests, in hopes of earlier and cheaper diagnoses. That earlier diagnoses could be critical in the effectiveness of any drug or medical treatment to cure this disease.

The proof of these results is based on self-duality and on a representation formula through which the moments of the components are related to exponential moments of the collision local time of random walks. Via large deviation theory, the latter lead to variational expressions for $b_*$ and the $b_m$'s, from which sharp bounds are deduced. The critical value $b_*$ arises from a stochastic representation of the Palm distribution of the system. The special case where $a(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is simple random walk is commonly referred to as the parabolic Anderson model with Brownian noise.

Current efforts on modeling blood flow have primarily focused on the flow properties of blood with red blood cells (RBCs) having a viscosity ratio $C$ of unity between the cytosol and suspending medium, while under physiological conditions the cytosol viscosity is about five times larger than the plasma viscosity (i.e., $C\\approx 5$). The importance of $C$ for the behavior of single RBCs in fluid flow has already been demonstrated, while the effect of $C$ on blood flow has only been sparsely studied. We employ mesoscopic hydrodynamic simulations to perform a systematic investigation of flow properties of RBC suspensions with different cytosol viscosities for various flow conditions in cylindrical microchannels. Our main aim is to link macroscopic flow properties such as flow resistance to single cell deformation and dynamics as a function of $C$. Starting from a dispersed cell configuration, we find that the flow convergence and the development of a RBC-free layer (RBC-FL) depend only weakly on $C$, and require a convergence length in the range of $25D-50D$, where $D$ is the channel diameter. The flow resistance for $C=5$ is nearly the same as that for $C=1$, which is facilitated by a slightly larger RBC-FL thickness for $C=5$. This effect is due to the suppression of membrane motion and dynamic shape deformations by a more viscous cytosol for $C=5$, resulting in a more compact cellular core of the flow in comparison to $C=1$. The weak effect of cytosol viscosity on the flow resistance and RBC-FL explains why cells can have a high concentration of hemoglobin for efficient oxygen delivery, without a pronounced increase in the flow resistance. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this study, we explore the effect of cytosol viscosity on the flow behavior of RBC suspensions in microvessels using a combination of microfluidic experiments, computational simulations, and theoretical analysis. Our results show that increasing the viscosity of the cytosol leads to a decrease in RBC deformability, which in turn enhances the aggregation and adhesion of RBCs in microvessels. We also find that the apparent viscosity of RBC suspensions increases with the cytosol viscosity, indicating higher resistance to flow in microvessels. Our computational simulations reveal that the cytosol viscosity influences the shear stress distribution on the RBC surface and affects the formation of the cell-free layer near the walls of microvessels. Moreover, our theoretical analysis suggests a non-linear relationship between the cytosol viscosity and the critical shear rate for RBC aggregation and adhesion. Overall, our study provides a deeper understanding of the interaction between RBCs and microvessels, and highlights the importance of the cytosol viscosity in determining the flow behavior of RBC suspensions in physiological and pathological conditions. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a literate Coq file. If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1442  In this paper, we investigate the differences between dynamic and static hadronic structure functions. Hadronic structure functions are crucial in understanding the internal structure of hadrons and are commonly used in high-energy physics experiments. Static structure functions assume that hadrons are composed of non-interacting point-like particles, while dynamic structure functions take into account the interactions between quarks and gluons within the hadron. We review the theoretical framework for both types of structure functions and analyze their behavior under different kinematic conditions. Our findings demonstrate that dynamic structure functions provide a more accurate description of hadronic structure in comparison to static structure functions. This has important implications for the interpretation of experimental data and may lead to more precise determinations of fundamental parameters in high-energy physics. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this paper, a theoretical framework is presented for modeling lateral movement attacks and for proposing a methodology for designing resilient cyber systems against such attacks.

      "Inserting test sample 1469  The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) with the energy grid has become an important area of research due to the increasing EV penetration in today's transportation systems. Under appropriate management of EV charging and discharging, the grid can currently satisfy the energy requirements of a considerable number of EVs. Furthermore, EVs can help enhance the reliability and stability of the energy grid through ancillary services such as energy storage. This paper proposes the EV routing problem with time windows under time-variant electricity prices (EVRPTW-TP) which optimizes the routing of an EV fleet that are delivering products to customers, jointly with the scheduling of the charging and discharging of the EVs from/to the grid. The proposed model is a multiperiod vehicle routing problem where EVs can stop at charging stations to either recharge their batteries or inject stored energy to the grid. Given the energy costs that vary based on time-of-use, the charging and discharging schedules of the EVs are optimized to benefit from the capability of storing energy by shifting energy demands from peak hours to off-peak hours when the energy price is lower. The vehicles can recover the energy costs and potentially realize profits by injecting energy back to the grid at high price periods. EVRPTW-TP is formulated as an optimization problem. A Lagrangian relaxation approach and a hybrid variable neighborhood search/tabu search heuristic are proposed to obtain high quality lower bounds and feasible solutions, respectively. Numerical experiments on instances from the literature are provided. The proposed heuristic is also evaluated on a case study of an EV fleet providing grocery delivery at the region of Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Insights on the impacts of energy pricing, service time slots, range reduction in winter as well as fleet size are presented. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In addition, the average shape of the X-ray spectrum is an important input into X-ray background synthesis models. Here, local (z \\approx 0) AGN luminosity functions (LFs) in five energy bands are used as a low-resolution, luminosity-dependent X-ray spectrometer in order to constrain the average AGN X-ray spectrum between 0.5 and 200 keV. The 15-55 keV LF measured by Swift-BAT is assumed to be the best determination of the local LF, and then a spectral model is varied to determine the best fit to the 0.5-2 keV, 2-10 keV, 3-20 keV and 14-195 keV LFs.\n",

For the quasi one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems, we derive an effective spin-orbital-lattice coupled model in the strong correlation limit with explicitly taking account of the t_2g orbital degeneracy, and investigate the model by numerical simulation as well as the mean-field analysis. We find a nontrivial feedback effect between orbital and spin degrees of freedom; as temperature decreases, development of antiferromagnetic spin correlations changes the sign of orbital correlations from antiferro to ferro type, and finally the ferro-type orbital correlations induce the dimerization and the spin-singlet formation. As a result of this interplay, the system undergoes a finite-temperature transition to the spin-dimer and orbital-ferro ordered phase concomitant with the Jahn-Teller lattice distortion. The numerical results for the magnetic susceptibility show a deviation from the Curie-Weiss behavior, and well reproduce the experimental data.

To deal with the ambiguity in the thin limit of branes of codimension higher than one, we consider a specific regularization of the internal structure of the branes where the 5D brane can be considered thin with respect to the 4D one. We consider the solutions corresponding to pure tension sources on the 4D brane, and study perturbations at first order around these background solutions. We adopt a 4D scalar-vector-tensor decomposition, and focus on the scalar sector of perturbations. We show that, in a suitable 4D limit, the trace part of the 4D metric perturbations obeys a decoupled equation which suggests that it is a ghost for background tensions smaller than a critical tension, while it is a healthy field otherwise. We give a geometrical interpretation of the existence of the critical tension and of the reason why the relevant field is a ghost or not depending on the background tension. We however find a value of the critical tension which is different from the one already found in the literature. Differently from the results in the literature, our analysis implies that, choosing the background tension suitably, we can construct ghost-free models for any value of the free parameters of the theory. We suggest that the difference lies in the procedure used to evaluate the pillbox integration across the codimension-2 brane. We confirm the validity of our analysis by performing numerically the integration in a particular case where the solution inside the thick cod-2 brane is known exactly. We stress that the singular structure of the perturbation fields in the nested branes set-ups is very subtle, and that great care has to be taken when deriving the codimension-2 junction conditions. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

This critical tension is characterized by a cascade of failures that occur when individual components fail and trigger failures in connected components. To better understand this phenomenon, we examined the behavior of the Cascading DGP model under varying degrees of stress and identified the key factors that contribute to the occurrence of critical tension.\n",

They show a bent tail morphology in agreement with a radio lobed galaxy falling into the cluster potential. Both galaxies are found to possess properties comparable with {narrow-angle} tail galaxies in the literature even though they are part of a low mass cluster. We find a spectral index steepening and an increase in fractional polarization through the galaxy jets and an ordered magnetic field component mostly aligned with the jet direction. This is likely caused by either shear due to the velocity difference of the intracluster medium and the jet fluid and/or magnetic draping of the intracluster medium across the galaxy jets. We find clear evidence that one source is showing two active galactic nuclei (AGN) outbursts from which we expect the AGN has never turned off completely.

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms.

Simulations of isolated gas-rich discs that resolve the clump substructure reveal that the cosmological simulations may overestimate R by ~30%, but the dominance of rotational support at high-z is not a resolution artifact. In turn, isolated gas-poor disc simulations produce at z=0 smaller gaseous non-rotating transient clouds, indicating that the difference in rotational support is associated with the fraction of cold baryons in the disc. In our current cosmological simulations, the clump rotation velocity is typically Vrot~100 km/s, but when beam smearing of \\geq 0.1 arcsec is imposed, the rotation signal is reduced to a small gradient of \\leq 30 km/s/kpc across the clump. The velocity dispersion in the simulated clumps is comparable to the disc dispersion so it is expected to leave only a marginal signal. Retrograde minor-merging galaxies could lead to massive clumps that do not show rotation.Testable predictions of the scenario as simulated are that the mean stellar age of the clumps, and the stellar fraction, are declining linearly with distance from the disc center. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1497  Obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to be very common in the Universe. Observations and surveys have shown that the number of sources increases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-called LLAGNs). Furthermore, many AGNs show changes in their obscuration properties at X-rays that may suggest a configuration of clouds very close to the accretion disk. However, these variations could also be due to changes in the intrinsic continuum of the source. It is therefore important to study nearby AGN to better understand the locus and distribution of clouds in the neighbourhood of the nucleus. We aim to study the nuclear obscuration of LLAGN NGC835 and its extended emission using mid-infrared observations. We present mid-infrared 11.5 microns imaging of the LLAGN galaxy NGC835 obtained with the instrument CanariCam in the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), archival Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy, and archival Chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013. The GTC/CanariCam 11.5 microns image reveals faint extended emission out to ~6 arcsec. We obtained a nuclear flux of F(11.5 microns) ~18 mJy, whereas the extended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. This means that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) IRS spectrum is dominated by this extended emission and not by the AGN, clearly seen in the Spitzer/IRS spectrum. Although the extended soft X-ray emission shows some resemblance with that of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at X-rays are mostly located in the inner side of this mid-infrared emission. The nuclear X-ray spectrum of the source has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013. We argue that this is most probably due to changes in the hydrogen column density from ~ 8x10E+23 cm-2 to ~ 3x10E+23 cm-2. NGC835 therefore is one of the few LLAGN, together with NGC1052, in which changes in the absorber can be claimed. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this work, we report on the long-term X-ray monitoring campaign of NGC835, focusing on its circumnuclear emission. We present the results of the X-ray spectral analysis, which indicate the presence of two distinct spectral components. The hard component dominates above ≈ 2 keV, and its flux exhibits a significant variability, ranging from a factor of ≈ 2 to 7. The soft component dominates below ≈ 2 keV, and its flux remains significantly constant over the entire period of observation. The observed variability of the hard component can be explained by the intrinsic variation of the LLAGN, while the soft component is likely due to the circumnuclear emission. Furthermore, we investigate the temporal correlation between the X-ray emission and the [O III] emission line flux. We found no significant correlation, implying distinct physical origins for the X-ray and [O III] emission. Finally, we estimated the accretion rate onto the central black hole of NGC835, assuming a range of models for the Comptonization process. Our results suggest that the accretion rate is low, within the range of (0.2−5) × 10−4 M ⊙ yr−1.

This flow evolves toward two-dimensional (2D) turbulence with increasing height in the tank. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements on the quasi-2D flow reveal many long-lived coherent vortices with a wide range of sizes. The vorticity fields exhibit vortex birth, merger, scattering, and destruction. We separate the flow into a low-entropy ``coherent'' and a high-entropy ``incoherent'' component by thresholding the coefficients of the DWPT and DWT of the vorticity fields. Similar thresholdings using the Fourier transform and JPEG compression together with the Okubo-Weiss criterion are also tested for comparison. We find that the DWPT and DWT yield similar results and are much more efficient at representing the total flow than a Fourier-based method. Only about 3% of the large-amplitude coefficients of the DWPT and DWT are necessary to represent the coherent component and preserve the vorticity probability density function, transport properties, and spatial and temporal correlations. The remaining small amplitude coefficients represent the incoherent component, which has near Gaussian vorticity PDF, contains no coherent structures, rapidly loses correlation in time, and does not contribute significantly to the transport properties of the flow.

      "Inserting test sample 1539  The Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3516 has undergone major spectral changes in recent years. In 2017 we obtained Chandra, NuSTAR, and Swift observations during its new low-flux state. Using these observations we model the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the intrinsic X-ray absorption, and compare the results with those from historical observations taken in 2006. We thereby investigate the effects of the changing-look phenomenon on the accretion-powered radiation and the ionized outflows. Compared to its normal high-flux state in 2006, the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of NGC 3516 was lower by a factor of 4 to 8 during 2017. Our SED modeling shows a significant decline in the luminosity of all the continuum components from the accretion disk and the X-ray source. As a consequence, the reprocessed X-ray emission lines have also become fainter. The Swift monitoring of NGC 3516 shows remarkable X-ray spectral variability on short (weeks) and long (years) timescales. We investigate whether this variability is driven by obscuration or the intrinsic continuum. We find that the new low-flux spectrum of NGC 3516, and its variability, do not require any new or variable obscuration, and instead can be explained by changes in the ionizing SED that result in lowering of the ionization of the warm-absorber outflows. This in turn induces enhanced X-ray absorption by the warm-absorber outflows, mimicking the presence of new obscuring gas. Using the response of the ionized regions to the SED changes, we place constraints on their density and location. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 1540  This research paper investigates the possible causes of a \"changing-look\" event in NGC 3516. We examine whether the observed changes in the continuum are due to intrinsic variability or obscuration variability. We analyzed multi-epoch optical spectra obtained from various observatories. We also examined historical data obtained from archives. The spectra cover a span of more than two decades, which allowed us to study the temporal evolution of the source. We found that the continuum flux decreased significantly, while the Balmer emission lines remained unchanged during the event. We tested the hypothesis of obscuration variability by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) with a combination of a power-law continuum and a dusty torus. The SED modeling supports the hypothesis of a dust-driven changing-look event. The dust is likely located in the vicinity of the broad-line region and is responsible for the changes in continuum flux. We also investigated the possibility of intrinsic variability by examining the flux variations of narrow emission lines. The results suggest that a variable ionizing continuum is unlikely to be the main cause of the changing-look event in NGC 3516. Our results show that the observed changes in the continuum flux are likely due to obscuration variability caused by dust.

In many large-scale applications, the construction of the index and its usage need to be considered as one unit of computation. Efficient string indexing and analysis in small space lies also at the core of a number of primitives in the data-intensive field of high-throughput DNA sequencing.

We show that the BWT of a string $T\\in \\{1,\\ldots,\\sigma\\}^n$ can be built in deterministic $O(n)$ time using just $O(n\\log{\\sigma})$ bits of space, where $\\sigma \\leq n$. Within the same time and space budget, we can build an index based on the BWT that allows one to enumerate all the internal nodes of the suffix tree of $T$. Many fundamental string analysis problems can be mapped to such enumeration, and can thus be solved in deterministic $O(n)$ time and in $O(n\\log{\\sigma})$ bits of space from the input string. We also show how to build many of the existing indexes based on the BWT, such as the CSA, the compressed suffix tree (CST), and the bidirectional BWT index, in randomized $O(n)$ time and in $O(n\\log{\\sigma})$ bits of space. The previously fastest construction algorithms for BWT, CSA and CST, which used $O(n\\log{\\sigma})$ bits of space, took $O(n\\log{\\log{\\sigma}})$ time for the first two structures, and $O(n\\log^{\\epsilon}n)$ time for the third, where $\\epsilon$ is any positive constant.

      "Inserting test sample 1559  Nearby sources may contribute to cosmic-ray electron (CRE) structures at high energies. Recently, the first DAMPE results on the CRE flux hinted at a narrow excess at energy ~1.4 TeV. We show that in general a spectral structure with a narrow width appears in two scenarios: I) \"Spectrum broadening\" for the continuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum. In this scenario, a finite width can develop after propagation through the Galaxy, which can reveal the distance of the source. Well-motivated sources include mini-spikes and subhalos formed by dark matter (DM) particles $\\chi_{s}$ which annihilate directly into e+e- pairs. II) \"Phase-space shrinking\" for burst-like sources with a power-law-like injection spectrum. The spectrum after propagation can shrink at a cooling-related cutoff energy and form a sharp spectral peak. The peak can be more prominent due to the energy-dependent diffusion. In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power index and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We analysis the DAMPE excess and find that the continuous DM sources should be fairly close within ~0.3 kpc, and the annihilation cross sections are close to the thermal value. For the burst-like source, the narrow width of the excess suggests that the injection spectrum must be hard with power index significantly less than two, the distance is within ~(3-4) kpc, and the age of the source is ~0.16 Myr. In both scenarios, large anisotropies in the CRE flux are predicted. We identify possible candidates of mini-spike (PWN) sources in the current Fermi-LAT 3FGL (ATNF) catalog.

      "Inserting test sample 1567  Simulation of unsteady creeping flows in complex geometries has traditionally required the use of a time-stepping procedure, which is typically costly and unscalable. To reduce the cost and allow for computations at much larger scales, we propose an alternative approach that is formulated based on the unsteady Stokes equation expressed in the time-spectral domain. This transformation results in a boundary value problem with an imaginary source term proportional to the computed mode that is discretized and solved in a complex-valued finite element solver using Bubnov-Galerkin formulation. This transformed spatio-spectral formulation presents several advantages over the traditional spatio-temporal techniques. Firstly, for cases with boundary conditions varying smoothly in time, it provides a significant saving in computational cost as it can resolve time-variation of the solution using a few modes rather than thousands of time steps. Secondly, in contrast to the traditional time integration scheme with a finite order of accuracy, this method exhibits a super convergence behavior versus the number of computed modes. Thirdly, in contrast to the stabilized finite element methods for fluid, no stabilization term is employed in our formulation, producing a solution that is consistent and more accurate. Fourthly, the proposed approach is embarrassingly parallelizable owing to the independence of the solution modes, thus enabling scalable calculations at a much larger number of processors. The comparison of the proposed technique against a standard stabilized finite element solver is performed using two- and three-dimensional canonical and complex geometries. The results show that the proposed method can produce more accurate results at 1% to 11% of the cost of the standard technique for the studied cases. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1569  (Abridged). The type-I X-ray bursting low mass X-ray binary KS 1731-260 was recently detected for the first time in quiescence by Wijnands et al., following an approximately 13 yr outburst which ended in Feb 2001. Unlike all other known transient neutron stars, the duration of this recent outburst is as long as the thermal diffusion time of the crust. The large amount of heat deposited by reactions in the crust will have heated the crust to temperatures much higher than the equilibrium core temperature. As a result, the thermal luminosity currently observed from the neutron star is dominated not by the core, but by the crust. Moreover, the level and the time evolution of quiescent luminosity is determined mostly by the amount of heat deposited in the crust during the most recent outburst. Using estimates of the outburst mass accretion rate, our calculations of the quiescent flux immediately following the end of the outburst agree with the observed quiescent flux to within a factor of a few. We present simulations of the evolution of the quiescent lightcurve for different scenarios of the crust microphysics, and demonstrate that monitoring observations (with currently flying instruments) spanning from 1--30 yr can measure the crust cooling timescale and the total amount of heat stored in the crust. These quantities have not been directly measured for any neutron star. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

By analyzing data obtained from both Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories, we have developed a comprehensive understanding of the crustal emission processes. We propose a physical model that accurately explains the sources of radiation, both thermal and non-thermal, encompassing all X-ray wavelengths. The model suggests that the surface temperature is strongly linked to the accretion rate, and by fitting the data with our model, we find that the temperature of the neutron star surface varies from 0.09-0.2 keV. Moreover, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that accretion heating is an important factor determining the quiescent spectrum of the neutron star. Our findings have significant implications for our understanding of neutron stars and their emission mechanisms and can also provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of compact objects and their surrounding environments. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We aim to explore the photosphere of the very cool late-type star VX Sgr and in particular the existence and characterization of molecular layers above the continuum forming photosphere. Methods. We obtained interferometric observations with the VLTI/AMBER interferometer using the fringe tracker FINITO in the spectral domain 1.45-2.50 micron with a spectral resolution of about 35 and baselines ranging from 15 to 88 meters.We perform independent image reconstruction for different wavelength bins and fit the interferometric data with a geometrical toy model.We also compare the data to 1D dynamical models of Miras atmosphere and to 3D hydrodynamical simulations of red supergiant (RSG) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Results. Reconstructed images and visibilities show a strong wavelength dependence. The H-band images display two bright spots whose positions are confirmed by the geometrical toy model. The inhomogeneities are qualitatively predicted by 3D simulations. At about 2,00 micron and in the region 2,35 - 2,50 micron, the photosphere appears extended and the radius is larger than in the H band. In this spectral region, the geometrical toy model locates a third bright spot outside the photosphere that can be a feature of the molecular layers. The wavelength dependence of the visibility can be qualitatively explained by 1D dynamical models of Mira atmospheres. The best-fitting photospheric models show a good match with the observed visibilities and give a photospheric diameter of theta = 8,82+-0,50 mas. The H2O molecule seems to be the dominant absorber in the molecular layers. Conclusions.

This group determined local thermodynamic properties of a system of ultra cold $^6\\mbox{Li}$ atoms tuned to Feshbach resonance. In this paper, I analyze the MIT data with a thermodynamic theory of unitary thermodynamics based on ideas from critical phenomena. This theory was introduced in the first paper of this sequence, and characterizes the scaled thermodynamics by the entropy per particle $z= S/N k_B$, and energy per particle $Y(z)$, in units of the Fermi energy. $Y(z)$ is in two segments, separated by a second-order phase transition at $z=z_c$: a \"normal\" segment for $z>z_c$, and a \"superfluid\" segment for $z<z_c$. For small $z$, the theory obeys a series $Y(z)=y_0+y_1 z^{\\alpha }+y_2 z^{2 \\alpha}+\\cdots,$ where $\\alpha$ is a constant exponent, and $y_i$ ($i\\ge 0$) are constant series coefficients.

However, the origin of these LABs is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate a merger model for the formation of LABs by studying Lya emission from interacting galaxies at high redshifts by means of a combination of hydrodynamics simulations with three dimensional radiative transfer calculations. Our galaxy simulations focus on a set of binary major mergers of galaxies with a mass range of 3-7 *10^12 Msun in the redshift range of z ~ 3 -7, and we use the newly improved ART^2 code to perform the radiative transfer calculations which couple multi-wavelength continuum, ionization of hydrogen, and Lya line emission. We find that intense star formation and enhanced cooling induced by gravitational interaction produce strong Lya emission from these merging galaxies. The Lya emission appears to be extended due to the extended distribution of sources and gas.

Sulphur, being moderately volatile, can be reliably measured in the interstellar medium (ISM) of damped Ly-alpha galaxies and extragalactic HII regions. Measurements in stars of different metallicity in our Galaxy can then be readily compared to the abundances in external galaxies. Such a comparison is not possible for Si or Ca that suffer depletion onto dust in the ISM. Furthermore, studying sulphur is interesting because it probes nucleosynthetic conditions that are very different from those of O or Mg. The measurements in star clusters are a reliable tracers of the Galactic evolution of sulphur.

Moreover the LTE sulphur abundance is consistent only with the abundance of another alpha-element, Mg, in the same star, while the low NLTE value is consistent with Si and Ca.

For each cluster, we derived ages and metallicities from isochrone fitting and high-resolution spectroscopy, respectively. The sulphur content, together with that of other key elements such as iron, α elements, and nitrogen, among others, was obtained from equivalent width measurements of stellar absorption lines in medium-resolution optical spectra. In particular, we focus on the abundance ratio [S/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H], and how it evolves with time and at different positions in the Galaxy. We find that [S/Fe] behaves similarly to other α elements, with a tendency to flatten out and become almost constant for stars with [Fe/H] > −0.5, whereas at lower metallicities it declines with decreasing [Fe/H]. This plateau in [S/Fe] is supported by chemical evolution models and owes to a complex interplay between the nucleosynthesis channels of sulphur (mainly massive stars and Type Ia supernovae) and the specific net yields, which are dependent on the initial stellar mass function and metallicity.

      "Inserting test sample 1603  The evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass in a stellar wind. Understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellar winds of AGB stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products of nucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining AGB evolution and predicting the chemical evolution of galaxies. In a previous paper we have constrained the structure of the outflowing envelope of W Hya using spectral lines of the $^{12}$CO molecule. Here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set of H$_{2}$O and $^{28}$SiO lines observed by the three instruments on board Herschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfer code. The oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$SiO abundance profile can be connected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formation at the base of the stellar wind, respectively. The modelling of H$_{2}$O and $^{28}$SiO confirms the properties of the envelope model of W Hya derived from $^{12}$CO lines. We find an H$_2$O ortho-to-para ratio of 2.5\\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an AGB wind. The O$^{16}$/O$^{17}$ ratio indicates that W Hya has an initial mass of about 1.5 M$_\\odot$. Although the ortho- and para-H$_{2}$O lines observed by HIFI appear to trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocity of $0.7\\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the HIFI lines of both spin isomers and those of $^{28}$SiO well.

      "Inserting test sample 1605  Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) may merge in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). It is suggested that the gravitational-wave (GW) emitted by a BBH has a high probability to be lensed by the SMBH if the BBH's orbit around the SMBH (i.e., the outer orbit) has a period of less than a year and is less than the duration of observation of the BBH by a space-borne GW observatory. For such a BBH + SMBH triple system, the de Sitter precession of the BBH's orbital plane is also significant. In this work, we thus study GW waveforms emitted by the BBH and then modulated by the SMBH due to effects including Doppler shift, de Sitter precession, and gravitational lensing. We show specifically that for an outer orbital period of 0.1 yr and an SMBH mass of $10^7 M_\\odot$, there is a 3\\%-10\\% chance for the standard, strong lensing signatures to be detectable by space-borne GW detectors such as LISA and/or TianGO. For more massive lenses ($\\gtrsim 10^8 M_\\odot$) and more compact outer orbits with periods <0.1 yr, retro-lensing of the SMBH might also have a 1%-level chance of detection. Furthermore, by combining the lensing effects and the dynamics of the outer orbit, we find the mass of the central SMBH can be accurately determined with a fraction error of $\\sim 10^{-4}$. This is much better than the case of static lensing because the degeneracy between the lens' mass and the source's angular position is lifted by the outer orbital motion.\n",

The statistical error on the deviation can be constrained to a 1% level. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

With the introduction of line edge roughness, the phonon transmission is reduced, but non-uniformly throughout the spectrum. We identify four distinct behaviors within the phonon spectrum in the presence of disorder: i) the low-energy, low-wavevector acoustic branches have very long mean-free-paths and are affected the least by edge disorder, even in the case of ultra-narrow W=1nm wide GNRs; ii) energy regions that consist of a dense population of relatively flat phonon modes (including the optical branches) are also not significantly affected, except in the case of the ultranarrow W=1nm GNRs, in which case the transmission is reduced because of band mismatch along the phonon transport path; iii) quasi-acoustic bands that lie within the intermediate region of the spectrum are strongly affected by disorder as this part of the spectrum is depleted of propagating phonon modes upon both confinement and disorder especially as the channel length increases; iv) the strongest reduction in phonon transmission is observed in energy regions that are composed of a small density of phonon modes, in which case roughness can introduce transport gaps that greatly increase with channel length.

We predict the radio emission from V830 Tau b, the youngest (2 Myr) detected exoplanet to date. We model the host star wind using 3DMHD simulations that take into account its surface magnetism. With this, we constrain the local conditions around V830 Tau b that we use to then compute its radio emission. We estimate average radio flux densities of 6 to 24mJy, depending on the assumed radius of the planet (one or two Rjupiter). These radio fluxes are present peaks that are up to twice the average values. We show here that these fluxes are weakly dependent (a factor of 1.8) on the assumed polar planetary magnetic field (10 to 100G), opposed to the maximum frequency of the emission, which ranges from 18 to 240MHz. We also estimate the thermal radio emission from the stellar wind. By comparing our results with VLA and VLBA observations of the system, we constrain the stellar mass-loss rate to be <3e-9 Msun/yr, with likely values between ~1e-12 and 1e-10 Msun/yr. The frequency-dependent extension of the radio-emitting wind is around ~ 3 to 30 Rstar for frequencies in the range of 275 to 50MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 Rstar, could be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically thick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so. Planetary emission can only propagate in the stellar wind plasma if the frequency of the cyclotron emission exceeds the stellar wind plasma frequency.

It has been shown that the large N limit of the partition function on S^1 x S^2 in the U(N) singlet sector of the CFT of N free complex scalars matches the one-loop thermal partition function of the Vasiliev theory in AdS_4, while in the O(N) singlet sector of the CFT of N real scalars it matches the minimal theory containing even spins only. We extend this matching to all dimensions d. We also calculate partition functions for the singlet sectors of free fermion CFT's in various dimensions and match them with appropriately defined higher spin theories, which for d>3 contain massless gauge fields with mixed symmetry. In the zero-temperature case R x S^{d-1} we calculate the Casimir energy in the scalar or fermionic CFT and match it with the one-loop correction in the global AdS_{d+1}.

For example, at a temperature of $10^9$ K, thermal nuclei typically experience $\\sim 10^{21}$ scatterings per second that are dominated by very small angle scattering leading to minuscule changes in the nuclear kinetic energy of order $\\mathcal{O}$(1) eV. In this paper the upper limit on the effects of a possible discretization of the $e^\\pm$ momenta by the PMF on the nuclear momentum distribution is estimated under the extreme assumptions that the momentum of the $e^\\pm$ is relaxed before and after Coulomb scattering to Landau levels, and that during Coulomb scattering the PMF is neglected. This assumption explicitly breaks the time reversal invariance of Coulomb scattering, and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is not a trivial steady state solution of the Boltzmann equation under these assumptions. We numerically evaluate the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation, and show that the introduction of a special direction in the $e^\\pm$ distribution by the PMF generates no directional dependence of the collisional destruction term of nuclei.

Typically, the relaxation to stationary values occurs over just a few tunneling times.

Using the synthetic colour magnitude diagram (CMD) technique with three types of evolutionary tracks of different metallicities, we have determined age, distance, reddening and indicative metallicity of these systems. The CMD of Be 20 is best reproduced by stellar models with a metallicity about half of solar (Z=0.008 or 0.01), in perfect agreement with high resolution spectroscopic estimates. Its age is between 5 and 6 Gyr from stellar models with overshooting and between 4.3 and 4.5 Gyr from models without it. The distance modulus from the best fitting models is always (m-M)0=14.7 (corresponding to a Galactocentric radius of about 16 kpc), and the reddening E(B-V) ranges between 0.13 and 0.16. A slightly lower metallicity (Z ~ 0.006) appears to be more appropriate for Be 66. This cluster is younger, (age of 3 Gyr), and closer, (m-M)0=13.3 (i.e., at 12 kpc from the Galactic centre), than Be 20, and suffers from high extinction, 1.2 < E(B-V) < 1.3, variable at the 2-3 per cent level.

Results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) show that Ti 2p core level peaks shift toward the lower binding energy with decrease in the buffer gas pressure (O2:Ar = 1:1). This suggests that oxygen vacancies are created under insufficient oxygen conditions. Anatase to rutile ratio is also found to be system pressure dependent. Under deposition pressure of 750 mTorr only anatase phase was observed even at 1073 K substrate temperature which is much higher that the bulk anatase to rutile phase transformation temperature.

Solid state ETp is sensitive to any static (conformational) or dynamic (vibrational) changes in the protein. Our macroscopic measurement technique extends the use of ETp meas-urements down to low temperatures and the concomitant lower current densities, because the larger area still yields measurable currents. Thus, we reported previously a surprising lack of temperature-dependence for ETp via the blue copper protein azurin (Az), from 80K till denaturation, while ETp via apo-(Cu-free) Az was found to be temperature de-pendent \\geq 200K.

We prove that the fibration $\\pi_{n,k} : C_{n}^G(S) \\to C_k^G(S)$ obtained by projecting on the first $k$ coordinates is a rational fibration. As a consequence, the space $C_{n}^G(S)$ has a Sullivan model $A_{n,k}=\\Lambda V_{C_k^G(S)}\\otimes \\Lambda V_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})}$ fitting in a cdga sequence: $\\Lambda V_{C_k^G(S)}\\to A_{n,k} \\to \\Lambda V_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})},$ where $\\Lambda V_X$ denotes the minimal model of $X$, and $C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})$ is the fiber of $\\pi_{n,k}$. We show that this model is minimal except for some cases when $S\\simeq S^2$ and compute in all the cases the higher $\\psi$-homotopy groups (related to the generators of the minimal model) of $C_n^G(S)$. We deduce from the computation that $C_n^G(S)$ having finite Betti numbers is a rational $K(\\pi,1)$, i.e its minimal model and $1$-minimal model are the same (or equivalently the $\\psi$-homotopy space vanishes in degree grater then $2$), if and only if $S$ is not homeomorphic to $S^2$. In particular, for $S$ not homeomorphic to $S^2$, the minimal model (isomorphic to the $1$-minimal model) is entirely determined by the Malcev Lie algebra of $\\pi_1 C_n^G(S)$. When $A_{n,k}$ is minimal, we get an exact sequence of Malcev Lie algebras $0\\to L_{C_{n-k}^G(S_{G,k})}\\to L_{C_{n}^G(S)}\\to L_{C_k^G(S)}\\to 0$, where $L_X$ is the Malcev Lie algebra of $\\pi_1X$. For $S \\varsubsetneq \\bar{S}=S^2$ and $G$ acting by orientation preserving homeomorphism, we prove that the cohomology ring of $C_n^G(S)$ is Koszul, and that for some of these spaces the minimal model can be obtained out of a Cartan-Chevally-Eilenberg construction applied to graded Lie algebra computed in an earlier work. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Therefore, detecting and properly accommodating focused objects is critical in video captioning. To enforce the description of focused objects and achieve controllable video captioning, we propose an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach (O2NA), which performs caption generation in three steps: 1) identify the focused objects and predict their locations in the target caption; 2) generate the related attribute words and relation words of these focused objects to form a draft caption; and 3) combine video information to refine the draft caption to a fluent final caption. Since the focused objects are generated and located ahead of other words, it is difficult to apply the word-by-word autoregressive generation process; instead, we adopt a non-autoregressive approach. The experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate the effectiveness of O2NA, which achieves results competitive with the state-of-the-arts but with both higher diversity and higher inference speed. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The proposed method utilizes visual object features and incorporates key information in the generation process, allowing for more fine-grained control over the generated captions. With this model, object information is used as a guide in the decoding process to ensure that each generated word is relevant to the specific objects in the frame. In order to optimize the model's performance, a multi-task training objective is used to maximize the captioning accuracy while minimizing the control loss. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that O2NA outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of controllability while maintaining overall captioning performance.

This is especially true in power-constrained environments, such as embedded and mobile computing. While lowering the operational voltage can reduce power consumption, there are limits imposed at design time, beyond which hardware components experience faulty operation. Moreover, the decrease in feature size has led to higher susceptibility to process variations, leading to reliability issues and lowering yield. However, not all computations and all data in a workload need to maintain 100% fidelity. In this paper, we explore the idea of employing functional or storage units that let go the conservative guardbands imposed on the design to guarantee reliable execution. Rather, these units exhibit Elastic Fidelity, by judiciously lowering the voltage to trade-off reliable execution for power consumption based on the error guarantees required by the executing code. By estimating the accuracy required by each computational segment of a workload, and steering each computation to different functional and storage units, Elastic Fidelity Computing obtains power and energy savings while reaching the reliability targets required by each computational segment.

      "Our aims are to provide valid magnetohydrostatic equilibria and to describe the current accumulations in various cases involving finite plasma pressure.To create our equilibrium current structures we use a full, non-resistive, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code so that no reconnection is allowed. A series of experiments are performed in which a perturbed 3D tilted null relaxes towards an equilibrium via real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial plasma pressure and to magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.An initially tilted fan is associated with a non-zero Lorentz force that drives the fan and spine to collapse towards each other, in a similar manner to the collapse of a 2D X-point. In the final equilibrium state for an initially radial null with only the current perpendicular to the spine, the current concentrates along the tilt axis of the fan and in a layer about the null point with a sharp peak at the null itself. The continued growth of this peak indicates that the system is in an asymptotic regime involving an infinite time singularity at the null. When the initial tilt disturbance (current perpendicular to the spine) is combined with a spiral-type disturbance (current parallel to the spine), the final current density concentrates in three regions: one on the fan along its tilt axis and two around the spine, above and below the fan. The increased area of current accumulation leads to a weakening of the singularity formed at the null.

The coronal magnetic field is one of the most important components in understanding and modeling the behavior of the Sun's corona. We investigate the relaxation of tangled magnetic field configurations induced by a process known as nanoflare heating. The MHD model is used to simulate the time evolution of the magnetic field in a region surrounding a 3D tilted null. The null region is inherently unstable and prone to reconnection, allowing for the magnetic energy to be released and transformed into heat and kinetic energy. We evaluate the effect of the tilt angle on the formation of current channels and their role in initiating the reconnection process. Our simulations demonstrate that increasing the tilt angle of the null causes the current channels to become narrower and more intense, leading to increased heating of the corona.

      "Inserting test sample 1765  Chiral effective lagrangians may differ in their prediction of meson-nucleon scattering amplitudes off-meson-mass-shell, but must yield identical S-matrix elements. We argue that the effective meson mass in nuclear matter obtained from chiral effective lagrangians is also unique. Off-mass-shell amplitudes obtained using the PCAC choice of pion field must therefore not be viewed as fundamental constraints on the dynamics, the determination of the effective meson mass in nuclear matter or the possible existence of meson condensates in the ground state of nuclear matter. This hypothesis is borne out by a calculation of the effective mass in two commonly employed formulations of chiral perturbation theory which yield different meson-nucleon scattering amplitudes off-meson-mass-shell. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 1767  The Hubbard model is a prototype for strongly correlated many-particle systems, including electrons in condensed matter and molecules, as well as for fermions or bosons in optical lattices. While the equilibrium properties of these systems have been studied in detail, the nonequilibrium dynamics following a strong non-perturbative excitation only recently came into the focus of experiments and theory. It is of particular interest how the dynamics depend on the coupling strength and on the particle number and whether there exist universal features in the time evolution. Here, we present results for the dynamics of finite Hubbard clusters based on a selfconsistent nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGF) approach invoking the generalized Kadanoff--Baym ansatz (GKBA). We discuss the conserving properties of the GKBA with Hartree--Fock propagators in detail and present a generalized form of the energy conservation criterion of Baym and Kadanoff for NEGF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the HF-GKBA cures some artifacts of prior two-time NEGF simulations. Besides, this approach substantially speeds up the numerical calculations and thus presents the capability to study comparatively large systems and to extend the analysis to long times allowing for an accurate computation of the excitation spectrum via time propagation. Our data obtained within the second Born approximation compares favorably with exact diagonalization results (available for up to 13 particles) and are expected to have predictive capability for substantially larger systems in the weak coupling limit. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

At higher temperatures, the precession amplitude decreases, becoming incoherent with a faster relaxation rate. The characteristic temperature of the spin dynamics is found to be around 1 K, which is consistent with the energy scale set by the exchange interaction. A magnetic field is found to modify the spin dynamics remarkably, and can evolve the precession into a coherent mode, leading to a non-equilibrium steady-state.

We use an extraction technique based on prior source positions at shorter wavelengths to build the 24 and 70um source catalogs. The majority (93%) of the sources have a spectroscopic (39%) or a photometric redshift (54%) and, in our redshift range of interest (i.e., 1.3<z<2.3) ~20% of the sources have a spectroscopic redshifts. To extend our study to lower 70um luminosities we perform a stacking analysis and we characterize the observed L_24/(1+z) vs L_70/(1+z) correlation. Using spectral energy distribution templates which best fit this correlation, we derive the IR luminosity of sources from their 24 and 70 um fluxes. We then compute the IR LF at z=1.55+/-0.25 and z=2.05+/-0.25. The redshift evolution of the IR LF from z=1.3 to z=2.3 is consistent with a luminosity evolution proportional to (1+z)^1.0+/-0.9 combined with a density evolution proportional to (1+z)^-1.1+/-1.5. At z~2, luminous IR galaxies (LIRGs: 10^11Lsun< LIR <10^12Lsun) are still the main contributors to the total comoving IR luminosity density (IR LD) of the Universe. At z~2, LIRGs and ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs: 10^12Lsun< LIR) account for ~49% and ~17% respectively of the total IR LD of the Universe. Combined with previous results for galaxies at z<1.3 and assuming a constant conversion between the IR luminosity and star-formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy, we study the evolution of the SFR density of the Universe from z=0 to z=2.3.

We aimed to determine the morphology and velocity structure for a large sample of the maser emission with generally lower peak flux densities than those in previous surveys. Using the European VLBI Network we imaged the remaining sources (17) from a sample of sources that were selected from the unbiased survey using the Torun 32 m dish. Together they form a database of a total of 63 source images with high sensitivity, milliarcsecond angular resolution and very good spectral resolution for detailed studies. We studied in detail the properties of the maser clouds and calculated the mean and median values of the projected size (17.4 au and 5.5 au, respectively) as well as the FWHM of the line (0.373 km s$^{-1}$ and 0.315 km s$^{-1}$ for the mean and median values, respectively), testing whether it was consistent with Gaussian profile. We also found maser clouds with velocity gradients (71 per cent) that ranged from 0.005 km s$^{-1}$ au$^{-1}$ to 0.210 km s$^{-1}$ au$^{-1}$.

Numerical simulations solving the compressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations were performed to investigate the reconnection onset within different atmospheric layers of the Sun, namely the corona, chromosphere and photosphere. A reconnecting state is reached for all atmospheric heights considered, with the dominant physics being highly dependent on atmospheric conditions. The coronal case achieves a sharp rise in electric field for a range of velocity drivers. For the chromosphere, we find a larger velocity amplitude is required to trigger reconnection. For the photospheric environment, the electric field is highly dependent on the inflow speed; a sharp increase in electric field is obtained only as the velocity entering the reconnection region approaches the Alfven speed.\n",

The effects of drain voltage, gate voltage and channel length have been investigated for such characteristics followed by a comparison with double-walled CNT-FET structure. First of all, it has been found that degree of ballisticity along with the optimum diameter increases with the increase of (VDS VGS). The increase of channel length, however, degrades the ballistic performance demanding a higher diameter to reach the optimum point.

      "Inserting test sample 1824  Carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFETs) have shown great potential for high-speed, low-power electronics. One of the key factors for their performance is the diameter of the nanotubes. In this study, we investigate the impact of nanotube diameter on the ballisticity of CNTFETs. By using an analytical model, we analyze the transfer characteristics of different CNTFETs with varying diameters. Our results show that an optimal diameter exists for achieving the highest degree of ballisticity in CNTFETs. We demonstrate that the optimal diameter depends on the gate length and the tube-tube interaction. Additionally, we find that increasing the diameter beyond the optimal value can lead to a decrease in ballisticity due to increased scattering. Our findings provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of CNTFETs. Furthermore, we propose a novel method for selecting the optimal nanotube diameter based on the device specifications. Our approach can potentially facilitate the development of high-performance CNTFETs for various applications in the future. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Such slopes are bluer than previously reported for any other galaxy population, and imply extinction-free, young, very low-metallicity stellar populations with a high ionizing photon escape fraction. Here we undertake a critical study of the evidence for such extreme values of beta, combining three new WFC3/IR-selected samples of galaxies spanning ~2 decades in UV luminosity over the redshift range z~4.5-8. We explore the impact of inclusion/exclusion of less robust high-z candidates, and use the varying depths of the samples to explore the effects of noise and selection bias. Simple data-consistency arguments suggest that artificially blue average values of beta can result when the analysis is extended into the deepest ~ 0.5-mag bin of these WFC3/IR-selected samples, regardless of the actual luminosity or z range probed. By confining attention to robust, well-detected high-z galaxy candidates, we find that the average value of beta is consistent with -2.05 +/- 0.10 for z=5-7, and -22 < M_UV < -18. We create and analyse a set of simulations which demonstrate that a bias towards artifically low/blue average values of beta is indeed expected when the UV slope analysis is extended towards the source detection threshold, and conclude that there is as yet no clear evidence for UV slopes significantly bluer than beta ~ -2, the typical value displayed by the bluest star-forming galaxies at more modest z.

      "Inserting test sample 1853  The genesis of lasing, as an evolution of the laser hybrid eigenstates comprised of electromagnetic modes and atomic polarization, is considered. It is shown that the start of coherent generation at the laser threshold is preceded by the formation of a special hybrid state at the lasing pre-threshold. This special state is characterized by an enhanced coupling among excited atoms and electromagnetic modes. This leads to an increase in the rate of stimulated emission in the special state and, ultimately, to lasing. At the lasing pre-threshold, the transformation of hybrid eigenstates has the features of an exceptional point (EP) observed in non-Hermitian systems. The special state is formed when eigenfrequencies of two hybrid states coalesce or come close to each other. Below the pre-threshold, lifetimes of all hybrid states grow with increasing pump rate. When the pump rate crosses the pre-threshold, resonance trapping occurs with the lifetime of the special state continuing to increase while the lifetimes of all other eigenstates begin to decrease. Consequently, the latter eigenstates do not participate in the lasing. Thus, above the pre-threshold, a laser transitions into the single-mode regime. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The coreshine phenomenon, a scattering process at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m that dominates absorption, has revealed its ability to explore the densest parts of clouds. We want to use this effect to constrain the dust parameters. The goal is to investigate to what extent grain growth (at constant dust mass) inside molecular clouds is able to explain the coreshine observations. We aim to find dust models that can explain a sample of Spitzer coreshine data. We also look at the consistency with near-infrared data we obtained for a few clouds. Methods. We selected four regions with a very high occurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and L183/L134. We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters to reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios of both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. The grid parameters allow to investigate the effect of coagulation upon spherical grains up to 5 $\\mu$m in size derived from the DustEm diffuse interstellar medium grains. Fluffiness (porosity or fractal degree), ices, and a handful of classical grain size distributions were also tested. We used the near- and mostly mid-infrared intensity ratios as strong discriminants between dust models. Results. The determination of the background field intensity at each wavelength is a key issue. In particular, an especially strong background field explains why we do not see coreshine in the Galactic plane at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m. For starless cores, where detected, the observed 4.5 $\\mu$m / 3.6 $\\mu$m coreshine intensity ratio is always lower than $\\sim$0.5 which is also what we find in the models for the Taurus-Perseus and L183 directions. Embedded sources can lead to higher fluxes (up to four times greater than the strongest starless core fluxes) and higher coreshine ratios (from 0.5 to 1.1 in our selected sample). Normal interstellar radiation field conditions are sufficient to find suitable grain models at all wavelengths for starless cores. The standard interstellar grains are not able to reproduce observations and, due to the multi-wavelength approach, only a few grain types meet the criteria set by the data. Porosity does not affect the flux ratios while the fractal dimension helps to explain coreshine ratios but does not seem able to reproduce near-infrared observations without a mix of other grain types. Conclusions. Combined near- and mid-infrared wavelengths confirm the potential to reveal the nature and size distribution of dust grains. Careful assessment of the environmental parameters (interstellar and background fields, embedded or nearby reddened sources) is required to validate this new diagnostic. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this work, we explore potential mechanisms that could explain the observed low o/p H2 ratios. Using a non-equilibrium gas-grain chemical model coupled to a 1D radiative transfer code, we simulate the chemical and thermal evolution of molecular gas in a filamentary cloud threaded by a strong magnetic field. Our simulations show that magnetic cooling, which is known to be a dominant cooling mechanism at high densities, can lead to a significant suppression of the para-H2 formation rate, thus lowering the o/p H2 ratio. The exact magnitude of this effect depends on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field, the initial chemical and thermal conditions, and the filament geometry. We also investigate the impact of other factors such as cosmic-ray ionization, UV irradiation, and ambipolar diffusion on the o/p H2 ratio.

However, real-world systems often exhibit extreme behavior that presents a challenge for traditional queueing models. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to queue analysis that leverages the MAD dispersion measure to capture the impact of extreme behavior. Specifically, we propose a framework that combines MAD-based queueing models with statistical techniques for estimating model parameters. We show that this approach yields more accurate performance estimates than traditional methods when applied to real-world systems exhibiting extreme behavior. Furthermore, our framework is easy to implement and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of complex systems.

      "Inserting test sample 1877  Large-scale atomistic simulations using the reactive empirical bond order force field approach is implemented to investigate thermal and mechanical properties of single-layer (SL) and multi-layer (ML) molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$). The amplitude of the intrinsic ripples of SL-MoS$_2$ are found to be smaller than those exhibited by graphene (GE). Furthermore, because of the van der Waals interaction between layers, the out-of-plane thermal fluctuations of ML-MoS$_2$ decreases rapidly with increasing number of layers. This trend is confirmed by the buckling transition due to uniaxial stress which occurs for a significantly larger applied tension as compared to graphene. For SL-MoS$_2$, the melting temperature is estimated to be 3700~K which occurs through dimerization followed by the formation of small molecules consisting of 2 to 5 atoms. When different types of vacancies are inserted in the SL-MoS$_2$ it results in a decrease of both the melting temperature as well as the stiffness. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Our results show that rippling in single-layer MoS$_2$ is initiated through the formation of metastable basins, while buckling in multi-layer MoS$_2$ is driven by the interlayer van der Waals forces.

No instrument detects all clouds, and analyses that use a given satellite climatology can only discuss a specific subset of clouds.

To do so, we identify where retrievals of Cloud Amounts (CAs), based on numerous sensors and algorithms, differ the most. We investigate large uncertainties, and confront retrievals from the CALIOP lidar, which detects semitransparent clouds and directly measures their vertical distribution, whatever the surface below. We document the cloud vertical distribution, opacity and seasonal variability where CAs from passive sensors disagree most. CALIOP CAs are larger than the passive average by +0.05 (AM) and +0.07 (PM). Over land, the +0.1 average difference rises to +0.2 over the African desert, Antarctica and Greenland, where large passive disagreements are traced to unfavorable surface conditions. Over oceans, CALIOP retrievals are closer to the average of passive retrievals except over the ITCZ (+0.1). Passive CAs disagree more in tropical areas associated with large-scale subsidence, where CALIOP observes a specific multi-layer cloud population: optically thin, high-level clouds and opaque (z>7km), shallow boundary layer clouds (z<2km).

We show that the system is a binary and does not contain a BH. Using spectral decomposition, we disentangle the observed composite spectra into two components: a rapidly rotating Be star and a slowly rotating B star with low surface gravity $(\\log g \\approx 2.75)$. Both stars show periodic radial velocity (RV) variability, but the RV semi-amplitude of the B star's orbit is $K_{\\rm B}= (62.7 \\pm 1)\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$, while that of the Be star is only $K_{\\rm Be} = (4.5\\pm 2)\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$. This implies that the B star is less massive by at least a factor of 10. The surface abundances of the B star bear imprints of CNO burning. We argue that the B star is a bloated, recently stripped helium star with mass $\\approx 0.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ that is currently contracting to become a hot subdwarf. The orbital motion of the Be star obviates the need for a BH to explain the B star's motion. A stripped-star model reproduces the observed luminosity of the system, while a normal star with the B star's temperature and gravity would be more than 10 times too luminous. HR 6819 and the binary LB-1 probably formed through similar channels.

The lifetime of their current evolutionary phase is on average $2\\times 10^5$ years, of order half a percent of the total lifetime of the Be phase.

The employed model for SMBH growth and feedback assumes a two-mode scenario in which the feedback from active galactic nuclei occurs through a kinetic, comparatively efficient mode at low accretion rates relative to the Eddington limit, and in the form of a thermal, less efficient mode at high accretion rates. We show that the quenching of massive central galaxies happens coincidently with kinetic-mode feedback, consistent with the notion that active supermassive black cause the low specific star formation rates observed in massive galaxies. However, major galaxy mergers are not responsible for initiating most of the quenching events in our model. Up to black hole masses of about $10^{8.5}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, the dominant growth channel for SMBHs is in the thermal mode. Higher mass black holes stay mainly in the kinetic mode and gas accretion is self-regulated via their feedback, which causes their Eddington ratios to drop, with SMBH mergers becoming the main channel for residual mass growth. As a consequence, the quasar luminosity function is dominated by rapidly accreting, moderately massive black holes in the thermal mode.

We show how a reduction is to be expected because any two galaxies with the same Mstar have at least one radius with identical surface density, where the galaxies have identical size. However, the reason why the scatter is reduced to the observed level is not trivial, and we pin it down to the galaxy surface density profiles approximately following Sersic profiles with their Re and Sersic index (n) anti-correlated (i.e., given Mstar, n increases when Re decreases). Our analytical results describe very well the behavior of the observed galaxies as portrayed in the NASA Sloan Atlas (NSA), which contains more than half a million local objects with 7 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 11.5. The comparison with NSA galaxies also allows us to find the optimal values for the mass surface density (2.4m0.9p1.3 Msun/pc2) and surface brightness (r-band 24.7pm0.5 mag/arcsec2) that minimize the scatter, although the actual values depend somehow on the subset of NSA galaxies used for optimization. The physical reason for the existence of optimal values is unknown but, as Trujillo+20 point out, they are close to the gas surface density threshold to form stars and thus may trace the physical end of a galaxy.

Understanding the correlation between these two factors can provide insight into galaxy formation and evolution. We have selected a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and used photometric and spectral data to calculate their available stellar mass and effective radius. Our analysis reveals a clear trend of increasing galaxy size with greater stellar mass.

The calculations at a finite $T$ demonstrated that a spin-ordered massive Dirac electron (SMD) appeared due to the on-site Coulomb interaction. We had an interest in the anomalous competitive effect with $U$ and SOI when the SMD phase is present in $\\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, and we investigated these contributions to the electronic state and conductivity. The SMD is not a conventional spin order, but it exhibits the spin-valley Hall effect. Direct current resistivity in the presence of a spin order gap increased divergently and exhibited negative magnetoresistance in the low $T$ region with decreasing $T$. The charge density hardly changed below and above the $T$ at which this insulating behavior appeared. However, when considering the SOI alone, the state changed to a topological insulator phase, and the electrical resistivity is saturated by edge conduction at quite low $T$. When considering both the SMD and the SOI, the spin order gap was suppressed by the SOI, and gaps with different sizes opened in the left and right Dirac cones.

      "Advanced image and video editing techniques are increasingly common in the image processing and computer vision world, and are also starting to be used in media entertainment. One common and difficult task closely linked to the world of video editing is image and video \" inpainting \". Generally speaking, this is the task of replacing the content of an image or video with some other content which is visually pleasing. This subject has been extensively studied in the case of images, to such an extent that commercial image inpainting products destined for the general public are available, such as Photoshop's \" Content Aware fill \" [1]. However, while some impressive results have been obtained in the case of videos, the subject has been studied far less extensively than image inpainting. This relative lack of research can largely be attributed to high time complexity due to the added temporal dimension. Indeed, it has only very recently become possible to produce good quality inpainting results on high definition videos, and this only in a semi-automatic manner. Nevertheless, high-quality video inpainting has many important and useful applications such as film restoration, professional post-production in cinema and video editing for personal use. For this reason, we believe that an automatic, generic video inpainting algorithm would be extremely useful for both academic and professional communities. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

A delicate control over the entire electroluminescence process is indispensable to overcome the efficiency limitations of blue PeLEDs. Here, we demonstrate an efficient device architecture to synergistically reduce the energetic losses during electron-photon conversion and boost the extraction of trapped light in the device. An interfacial nucleation seeding scheme is proposed to control the crystallization process of highly emissive perovskite nanocrystals and suppress the trap-mediated non-radiative recombination losses due to interfacial hydrogen bonding interactions. This manipulation results in a record external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.8% for blue PeLEDs emitting at 486 nm, along with the improved spectral stability and operation lifetime. Additionally, the maximum EQE reaches 16.8% after combining an internal outcoupling structure without spectral distortion, which can be further raised to 27.5% when using a lens-based structure on top of the device.

From this model, we develop a multi-agent simulation to study the integration of the consumers' flexibility into the system. Our study identifies the conditions that real-time prices may lead to higher electricity costs, which in turn contradicts the usual claim that such a pricing scheme reduces cost. We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact systemic. Due to the existing structure of the wholesale market, the predicted demand that is used in the formation of the price is never realized since the flexible users will change their demand according to such established price. As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the balancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the system can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users, but this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs. To avoid this problem, we implement the so-called \"exclusive groups.\" Our results illustrate the importance of rethinking the current practices so that flexibility can be successfully integrated considering scenarios with and without intermittent renewable sources. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

This study employs a simulation model to compare the outcomes of real-time pricing and market integration on energy consumption, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. The results suggest that market integration could potentially lead to a lower overall cost of energy for consumers and reduced emissions, but it may also require significant changes in the energy market structure. Real-time pricing, on the other hand, could offer more flexibility and simplicity for consumers, but its effectiveness may depend on the level of price elasticity and the availability of real-time data.

Exploiting the idea of the multiple shooting method, the proposed approach calculates the initial values at each subinterval as well as the corresponding period iteratively. As in the Parareal method, parallelization in the time domain is performed using discretization on a two-level grid. A special linearization of the time-periodic system on the coarse grid is introduced to speed up the computations.

      "Inserting test sample 1933  There is a long-standing discrepancy between galaxy cluster masses determined from X-ray and gravitational lensing observations of which Abell 1689 is a well-studied example. In this work we take advantage of 180 ks of Chandra X-ray observations and a new weak gravitational study based on a Hubble Space Telescope mosaic covering the central 1.8 Mpc x 1.4 Mpc to eliminate the mass discrepancy. In contrast to earlier X-ray analyses where the very circular surface brightness has been inferred as Abell 1689 being spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium, a hardness ratio map analysis reveals a regular and symmetric appearing main clump with a cool core plus some substructure in the North Eastern part of the cluster. The gravitational lensing mass model supports the interpretation of Abell 1689 being composed of a main clump, which is possibly a virialized cluster, plus some substructure. In order to avoid complications and mis-interpretations due to X-ray emission from the substructure, we exclude it from the mass reconstruction. Comparing X-ray and lensing mass profiles of the regular main part only, shows no significant discrepancy between the two methods and the obtained mass profiles are consistent over the full range where the mass can be reconstructed from X-rays (out to approx. 1 Mpc).

The measurements are combined with other studies, providing a self-consistent measurement of the star formation history of the Universe over the last ~11Gyrs.

First, thesize of the boundary layer on the western and eastern boundary, whichhad already been computed by several authors, becomes formally verylarge as one approaches northern and southern portions of the boudary,i.e. pieces of the boundary on which the normal is vertical. Thisphenomenon is known as geostrophic degeneracy. In order to avoid suchsingular behaviour, previous studies imposed restrictive assumptionson the domain $\\Omega$ and on the forcing term $\\tau$. Here, we provethat a superposition of two boundary layers occurs in the vicinity ofsuch points: the classical western or eastern boundary layers, andsome northern or southern boundary layers, whose mathematicalderivation is completely new. The size of northern/southern boundarylayers is much larger than the one of western boundary layers($\\mathfrak{E}^{1/4}$ vs. $\\mathfrak{E}^{1/3}$). We explain in detail how the superpositiontakes place, depending on the geometry of the boundary.Moreover, when the domain $\\Omega$ is not connex in the $x$ direction,$\\psi^0$ is not continuous in $\\Omega$, and singular layers appear inorder to correct its discontinuities. These singular layers areconcentrated in the vicinity of horizontal lines, and thereforepenetrate the interior of the domain $\\Omega$. Hence we exhibit some kindof boundary layer separation.\n",

      "However, we emphasize that we remainable to prove a convergence theorem, so that the singular layerssomehow remain stable, in spite of the separation.Eventually, the effect of boundary layers is non-local in severalaspects. On the first hand, for algebraic reasons, the boundary layerequation is radically different on the west and east parts of theboundary.\n",

      "As a consequence, the Sverdrup equation is endowed with aDirichlet condition on the East boundary, and no condition on the Westboundary. Therefore western and eastern boundary layers have in factan influence on the whole domain $\\Omega$, and not only near theboundary. On the second hand, the northern and southern boundary layerprofiles obey a propagation equation, where the space variable $x$plays the role of time, and are therefore not local. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In many cases, these processes are strongly influenced by the presence of boundaries, such as coastlines or oceanic ridges, which can give rise to boundary layers that have a significant impact on the overall circulation pattern. In this paper, we present a mathematical study of one particular type of boundary layer: the degenerate boundary layer that occurs in large-scale ocean circulation problems.\n",

      "The degenerate boundary layer arises when the thickness of the boundary layer becomes comparable to the characteristic length scales of the problem. In the context of large-scale ocean circulation, this can occur in regions where the Coriolis force is weak or vanishes, such as the equatorial regions or certain parts of the Southern Ocean. Under such conditions, the momentum equations that govern the flow exhibit a singular behavior, with the boundary layer becoming extremely thin and the velocity gradients becoming very large.\n",

We begin by deriving a set of simplified equations that capture the essential features of the degenerate boundary layer, including the dominance of advection over diffusion and the presence of strong lateral shear. We then carry out a detailed analysis of these simplified equations, using both analytical and numerical methods to investigate the behavior of the flow.\n",

      "Our results show that the presence of degenerate boundary layers can have a significant impact on the overall circulation pattern in large-scale ocean systems. In particular, we find that the boundary layers can give rise to highly localized eddies and jets that are not captured by traditional models of the oceanic circulation. These features have important implications for a wide range of processes, including the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients, as well as the distribution of marine organisms.\n",

Due to their importance, identifying acronyms and corresponding phrases (i.e., acronym identification (AI)) and finding the correct meaning of each acronym (i.e., acronym disambiguation (AD)) are crucial for text understanding. Despite the recent progress on this task, there are some limitations in the existing datasets which hinder further improvement. More specifically, limited size of manually annotated AI datasets or noises in the automatically created acronym identification datasets obstruct designing advanced high-performing acronym identification models. Moreover, the existing datasets are mostly limited to the medical domain and ignore other domains. In order to address these two limitations, we first create a manually annotated large AI dataset for scientific domain. This dataset contains 17,506 sentences which is substantially larger than previous scientific AI datasets. Next, we prepare an AD dataset for scientific domain with 62,441 samples which is significantly larger than the previous scientific AD dataset.

By demanding that these finite lumps of relativistic fluid are described by a thermal partition function with arbitrary stationary background metric and gauge fields, we are able to find several constraints among surface transport coefficients. At leading order, besides recovering the surface thermodynamics, we obtain a generalization of the Young-Laplace equation for relativistic fluid surfaces, by considering a temperature dependence in the surface tension, which is further generalized in the context of superfluids. At the next order, for uncharged fluids in 3+1 dimensions, we show that besides the 3 independent bulk transport coefficients previously known, a generic localized configuration is characterized by 3 additional surface transport coefficients, one of which may be identified with the surface modulus of rigidity.

      "Inserting test sample 1975  Among many topological indices of trees the sum of distances $\\sigma(T)$ and the number of subtrees $F(T)$ have been a long standing pair of graph invariants that are well known for their negative correlation. That is, among various given classes of trees, the extremal structures maximizing one usually minimize the other, and vice versa. By introducing the \"local\" versions of these invariants, $\\sigma_T(v)$ for the sum of distance from $v$ to all other vertices and $F_T(v)$ for the number of subtrees containing $v$, extremal problems can be raised and studied for vertices within a tree. This leads to the concept of \"middle parts\" of a tree with respect to different indices. A challenging problem is to find extremal values of the ratios between graph indices and corresponding local functions at middle parts or leaves. This problem also provides new opportunities to further verify the the correlation between different indices such as $\\sigma(T)$ and $F(T)$. Such extremal ratios, along with the extremal structures, were studied and compared for the distance and subtree problems for general trees In this paper this study is extended to binary trees, a class of trees with numerous practical applications in which the extremal ratio problems appear to be even more complicated. After justifying some basic properties on the distance and subtree problems in trees and binary trees, characterizations are provided for the extremal structures achieving two extremal ratios in binary trees of given order. The generalization of this work to $k$-ary trees is also briefly discussed. The findings are compared with the previous established extremal structures in general trees.

We consider a collection of extremal ratios that shed light on the difficulty of these problems. Our results show that these ratios vary considerably between the two problems, and that they can differ by several orders of magnitude. In particular, we provide tight bounds on the largest and smallest possible values of each ratio in both problems. Our analysis reveals that the distance problem is generally more difficult than the subtree problem, in the sense that its extremal ratios are larger and more variable. We also investigate the effect of various tree parameters on these ratios, including tree size, height, degree, and balance. Our main findings suggest that the extremal ratios depend primarily on the depth of the tree and the distribution of its degree sequence. Finally, we propose several open problems and directions for future research, including randomized and approximation algorithms for the distance and subtree problems, and the analysis of these problems in other classes of trees.

Within this scheme the phenomenon of geometric scaling takes place: cross sections are functions only of a dimensionless combination of the relevant kinematic variables, which happens both in inclusive and diffractive cases, as in the production of vector mesons. In particular, the scaling variable is given in general by $\\tau = Q^2/Q_s^2$, where $Q^2$ is the photon virtuality and $Q_s$ represents the saturation scale, which drives the energy dependence and the corresponding nuclear effects. Based on the scaling property, we are able to derive a universal expression for the cross sections for the exclusive vector meson production and deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) in both photon-proton and photon-nucleus interactions.

We found that the formation of plages often preceded flare activity, suggesting that the presence of active regions on the surface of LQ Hydrae may increase the likelihood of flaring. Furthermore, we detected rapid fluctuations in the magnetic and velocity fields of the star, likely caused by small-scale instabilities. Interestingly, we observed an inverse correlation between the brightness of plages and the strength of magnetic fields within them.

      "Inserting test sample 1998  This research investigates the possibility of tailoring the magnetic properties of Cr1+{\\delta}Te2 epitaxial films through self-intercalation. The films were grown using molecular beam epitaxy, and their structures were characterized through X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. The study reveals that self-intercalation can modify the thickness of the Te layers in the films, leading to changes in their structural and magnetic properties. It was found that the magnetic properties of the films are influenced by Cr vacancies that are formed during the self-intercalation process. The results show that self-intercalation can tune the magnetic moment per Cr atom, as well as the magnetic anisotropy energy, by controlling the amount of Cr vacancies in the films.

Starting from the respective model equations for a non-conserved system, a conserved system and a binary fluid, we derive the interface equations which are a coupled set of equations for deformations of the boundaries of each domain. A further reduction of the degrees of freedom is possible for a non-conserved system such that internal motion of each domain is adiabatically eliminated. The resulting equation of motion contains only the displacement of the center of gravity of domains, which is equivalent to the phase variable of a periodic structure. Thus our formulation automatically includes the phase dynamics of layered structures.

We show that ingoing (collapsing) dust shell modes outside the apparent horizon must necessarily be accompanied by outgoing modes inside the apparent horizon, whose amplitude is suppressed by the square root of the Boltzmann factor at the Hawking temperature. Likewise, ingoing modes in the interior must be accompanied by outgoing modes in the exterior, again with an amplitude suppressed by the same factor. A suitable superposition of the two solutions is necessary to conserve the dust probability flux across the apparent horizon, thus each region contains both ingoing and outgoing dust modes. If one restricts oneself to considering only the modes outside the apparent horizon then one should think of the apparent horizon as a partial reflector, the probability for a shell to reflect being given by the Boltzmann factor at the Hawking temperature determined by the mass contained within it. However, if one considers the entire wave function, the outgoing wave in the exterior is seen to be the transmission through the horizon of the interior outgoing wave that accompanies the collapsing shells. This transmission could allow information from the interior to be transferred to the exterior. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 2009  Many experimental and field studies have shown that adaptation can occur very rapidly. Two qualitatively different modes of fast adaptation have been proposed: selective sweeps wherein large shifts in the allele frequencies occur at a few loci and evolution via small changes in the allele frequencies at many loci. While the first process has been thoroughly investigated within the framework of population genetics, the latter is based on quantitative genetics and is much less understood. Here we summarize results from our recent theoretical studies of a quantitative genetic model of polygenic adaptation that makes explicit reference to population genetics to bridge the gap between the two frameworks. Our key results are that polygenic adaptation may be a rapid process and can proceed via subtle or dramatic changes in the allele frequency depending on the sizes of the phenotypic effects relative to a threshold value. We also discuss how the signals of polygenic selection may be detected in the genome. While powerful methods are available to identify signatures of selective sweeps at loci controling quantitative traits, the development of statistical tests for detecting small shifts of allele frequencies at quantitative trait loci is still in its infancy. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2010  Polygenic adaptation refers to the process by which complex traits are modified through natural selection acting on multiple genetic variants of small effect. Understanding the modes of rapid polygenic adaptation is essential for predicting the evolution of complex traits, such as susceptibility to diseases. Multiple modes of rapid polygenic adaptation have been proposed, including shifts in allele frequencies, changes in the frequency of haplotypes, and changes in the frequency of polygenic scores. However, the relative importance of these modes of adaptation remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore the different modes of rapid polygenic adaptation using both analytical and simulation approaches. Our results suggest that the relative importance of each mode depends on the underlying genetic architecture of the polygenic trait. In particular, we find that the importance of allele frequency changes is highest when the trait is influenced by a small number of loci of large effect, whereas changes in haplotype and polygenic score frequencies become more important when the trait is influenced by many loci of small effect.

      "Inserting test sample 2030  The phenomenon of supernova-driven interstellar turbulence is a crucial factor in understanding the behavior of galactic magnetic fields. The immense energy released by supernovae creates shock waves that propagate and generate turbulence in the surrounding interstellar medium. This turbulence, in turn, plays a critical role in the creation of galactic magnetic fields through the so-called \"galactic dynamo\" mechanism which amplifies random seed fields into a coherent large-scale magnetic field. Despite decades of study, our understanding of both supernova-driven turbulence and the galactic dynamo mechanism remains far from complete. This paper presents recent advances in both observational and theoretical work aimed at shedding light on these fundamental processes and their role in shaping galactic structure. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 2035  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the setup uncertainties for single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SF-SRS) based on the clinical data with the two different mask-creation methods using pretreatment CBCT imaging guidance. Dedicated frameless fixation BrainLAB masks for 23 patients were created as a routine mask (R-mask) making method, as explained in the BrainLAB user manual. The alternative masks (A-mask) which were created by modifying the cover range of the R-mask for the patient head were used for 23 patients. The systematic errors including the each mask and stereotactic target localizer were analyzed and the errors were calculated as the mean and standard deviation (SD) from the LR, SI, AP, and yaw setup corrections. In addition, the frequency of three-dimensional (3D) vector length were also analyzed. The values of the mean setup corrections for the R-mask in all directions were small; < 0.7 mm and < 0.1 degree, whereas the magnitudes of the SDs were relatively large compared to the mean values. In contrast to the R-mask, the means and SDs of the A-mask were smaller than those for the R-mask with the exception of the SD in the AP direction. The mean and SD in the yaw rotational direction in the R-mask and A-mask system were comparable. The 3D vector shifts of a larger magnitude occurred more frequently for the R-mask than the A-mask. The setup uncertainties for each mask with the stereotactic localizing system had an asymmetric offset towards the positive AP direction. The A-mask-creation method, which is capable of covering the top of the patient head is superior to that for R-mask, and thereby the use of the A-mask is encouraged for SF-SRS to reduce the setup uncertainties. Moreover, the careful mask making is required to prevent the possible setup uncertainties. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

However, due to the instable energy supply and the limited battery capacity, renewable energy cannot guarantee to provide the perpetual operation for wireless sensor networks (WSN). The coexistence of renewable energy and electricity grid is expected as a promising energy supply manner to remain function for a potentially infinite lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new system model suitable for WSN, taking into account multiple energy consumptions due to sensing, transmission and reception, heterogeneous energy supplies from renewable energy, electricity grid and mixed energy, and multidimension stochastic natures due to energy harvesting profile, electricity price and channel condition. A discrete-time stochastic cross-layer optimization problem is formulated to achieve the optimal trade-off between the time-average rate utility and electricity cost subject to the data and energy queuing stability constraints. The Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty with perturbation technique and block coordinate descent method is applied to obtain a fully distributed and low-complexity cross-layer algorithm only requiring knowledge of the instantaneous system state.

We use the velocity field maps obtained with SINFONI/VLT on the MASSIV sample, selected from the star-forming population in the VVDS. We identify physical pairs of galaxies from the measurement of the relative velocity and the projected separation (r_p) of the galaxies in the pair. Using the well constrained selection function of the MASSIV sample we derive the gas-rich major merger fraction (luminosity ratio mu = L_2/L_1 >= 1/4), and, using merger time scales from cosmological simulations, the gas-rich major merger rate at a mean redshift up to z = 1.54. We find a high gas-rich major merger fraction of 20.8+15.2-6.8 %, 20.1+8.0-5.1 % and 22.0+13.7-7.3 % for close pairs with r_p <= 20h^-1 kpc in redshift ranges z = [0.94, 1.06], [1.2, 1.5) and [1.5, 1.8), respectively.

The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training.

A player seeks to activate $K \\geq 1$ arms at each time in order to maximize the expected total reward obtained over multiple plays. RMAB is a challenging problem that is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. We consider in this work the even harder non-Bayesian RMAB, in which the parameters of the Markov chain are assumed to be unknown \\emph{a priori}. We develop an original approach to this problem that is applicable when the corresponding Bayesian problem has the structure that, depending on the known parameter values, the optimal solution is one of a prescribed finite set of policies. In such settings, we propose to learn the optimal policy for the non-Bayesian RMAB by employing a suitable meta-policy which treats each policy from this finite set as an arm in a different non-Bayesian multi-armed bandit problem for which a single-arm selection policy is optimal. We demonstrate this approach by developing a novel sensing policy for opportunistic spectrum access over unknown dynamic channels. We prove that our policy achieves near-logarithmic regret (the difference in expected reward compared to a model-aware genie), which leads to the same average reward that can be achieved by the optimal policy under a known model.

      "Inserting test sample 2063  We define and study XOR games in the framework of general probabilistic theories, which encompasses all physical models whose predictive power obeys minimal requirements. The bias of an XOR game under local or global strategies is shown to be given by a certain injective or projective tensor norm, respectively. The intrinsic (i.e.\\ model-independent) advantage of global over local strategies is thus connected to a universal function $r(n,m)$ called 'projective-injective ratio'. This is defined as the minimal constant $\\rho$ such that $\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\pi Y}\\leq\\rho\\,\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\varepsilon Y}$ holds for all Banach spaces of dimensions $\\dim X=n$ and $\\dim Y=m$, where $X\\otimes_\\pi Y$ and $X \\otimes_\\varepsilon Y$ are the projective and injective tensor products. By requiring that $X=Y$, one obtains a symmetrised version of the above ratio, denoted by $r_s(n)$. We prove that $r(n,m)\\geq 19/18$ for all $n,m\\geq 2$, implying that injective and projective tensor products are never isometric. We then study the asymptotic behaviour of $r(n,m)$ and $r_s(n)$, showing that, up to log factors: $r_s(n)$ is of the order $\\sqrt{n}$ (which is sharp); $r(n,n)$ is at least of the order $n^{1/6}$; and $r(n,m)$ grows at least as $\\min\\{n,m\\}^{1/8}$.

In our proof, a crucial role is played by an '$\\ell_1$/$\\ell_2$/$\\ell_{\\infty}$ trichotomy theorem' based on ideas by Pisier, Rudelson, Szarek, and Tomczak-Jaegermann. The main operational consequence we draw is that there is a universal gap between local and global strategies in general XOR games, and that this grows as a power of the minimal local dimension.

      "Inserting test sample 2065  We consider a class of mean field games in which the agents interact through both their states and controls, and we focus on situations in which a generic agent tries to adjust her speed (control) to an average speed (the average is made in a neighborhood in the state space). In such cases, the monotonicity assumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not hold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems of forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are supplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular Neumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the underlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with numerical approximations of the above mentioned systems. After describing the finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when the parameters of the model vary. The theory of mean field games, (MFGs for short), aims at studying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria) as the number of agents tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational agents are indistinguishable and individually have a negligible influence on the game, and that each individual strategy is influenced by some averages of quantities depending on the states (or the controls as in the present work) of the other agents.

The diverse applications range from single-electron transistors based on electronic Coulomb blockade to quantum logic gates in Rydberg atoms. We have observed a new kind of interaction blockade in transferring ultracold atoms between orbitals in an optical lattice. In this system, atoms on the same lattice site undergo coherent collisions described by a contact interaction whose strength depends strongly on the orbital wavefunctions of the atoms. We induce coherent orbital excitations by modulating the lattice depth and observe a staircase-type excitation behavior as we cross the interaction-split resonances by tuning the modulation frequency. As an application of orbital excitation blockade (OEB), we demonstrate a novel algorithmic route for cooling quantum gases. Our realization of algorithmic cooling utilizes a sequence of reversible OEB-based quantum operations that isolate the entropy in one part of the system, followed by an irreversible step that removes the entropy from the gas. This work opens the door to cooling quantum gases down to ultralow entropies, with implications for developing a microscopic understanding of strongly correlated electron systems that can be simulated in optical lattices. In addition, the close analogy between OEB and dipole blockade in Rydberg atoms provides a roadmap for the implementation of two-qubit gates in a quantum computing architecture with natural scalability. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Using ALMA observations of a number of tracers (12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), 12CO(3-2), 13CO(2-1) and HCO+(4-3)), we map the differences in excitation, density and temperature of the gas. The results show that in the immediate vicinity of the radio jet, a fast outflow, with velocities up to 800 km/s, is occurring of which the gas has high excitation temperatures in the range 30-55 K, demonstrating the direct impact of the jet on the ISM. The relative brightness of the CO lines show that the outflow is optically thin. We estimate the mass of the molecular outflow to be 1.2 x 10^6 Msol and likely to be a factor 2-3 larger. This is similar to that of the outflow of atomic gas, but much larger than that of the ionised outflow, showing that the outflow is dominated by cold gas. The total mass outflow rate we estimate to be ~12 Msol/yr. The mass of the outflow is much smaller than the total gas mass of the ISM of IC 5063.

Gosta, Nobel Lectures in Physics (2001-2005), World Scientific (2008)], there has been a huge experimental and theoretical push to try and illuminate a superfluid state of Wannier-Mott excitons. Excitons in quantum wells, generated by a laser pulse, typically diffuse only a few micrometers from the spot they are created. However, Butov et al. and Snoke et al. reported luminescence from indirect and direct excitons hundreds of micrometers away from the laser excitation spot in double and single quantum well (QW) structures at low temperatures.

As part of an ongoing effort to uncover and control systematic uncertainties, we investigate three potential sources: 1- stellar kinematics, 2- line-of-sight effects, and 3- the deflector mass model. To meet this goal in a quantitative way, we reproduced the H0LiCOW/SHARP/STRIDES (hereafter TDCOSMO) procedures on a set of real and simulated data, and we find the following. First, stellar kinematics cannot be a dominant source of error or bias since we find that a systematic change of 10% of measured velocity dispersion leads to only a 0.7% shift on $H_0$ from the seven lenses analyzed by TDCOSMO. Second, we find no bias to arise from incorrect estimation of the line-of-sight effects.

If the two models disagree, as in the case of some pathological models illustrated here, the TDCOSMO procedure either discriminates between them through the goodness of fit, or it accounts for the discrepancy in the final error bars provided by the analysis. This conclusion is consistent with a reanalysis of six of the TDCOSMO (real) lenses: the composite model yields $74.0^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$ $km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$, while the power-law model yields $H_0=74.2^{+1.6}_{-1.6}$ $km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$.

      "Inserting test sample 2139  Context: Meta programming consists for a large part of matching, analyzing, and transforming syntax trees. Many meta programming systems process abstract syntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data type describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is error-prone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure of such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta programmer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the object language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require a concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST structures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis, static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks.\n",

However, the LMC is a dwarf irregular galaxy, quite different from the massive spiral galaxies used for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale. Recent investigations suggest that not only the zero-point but also the slope of the Milky Way PL relation differ significantly from that of the LMC, casting doubts on the universality of the Cepheid PL relation. We want to make a differential comparison of the PL relations in the two galaxies by delineating the PL relations using the same method, the infrared surface brightness method (IRSB), and the same precepts. The IRSB method is a Baade-Wesselink type method to determine individual distances to Cepheids. We apply a newly revised calibration of the method as described in an accompanying paper (Paper I) to 36 LMC and five SMC Cepheids and delineate new PL relations in the V,I,J, & K bands as well as in the Wesenheit indices in the optical and near-IR. We present 509 new and accurate radial velocity measurements for a sample of 22 LMC Cepheids, enlarging our earlier sample of 14 stars to include 36 LMC Cepheids.

      "Inserting test sample 2144  This study explores the impact of metallicity and the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the calibration of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity (PL) relation using the infrared surface brightness (IRSB) technique. The Cepheid PL relation is essential for measuring cosmic distances and is widely used in the field of astronomy. However, it is known that the relation depends on metallicity, with lower metallicity stars exhibiting weaker line-blanketing, leading to a hotter and bluer temperature, and thus affecting their luminosity. We conduct a detailed analysis of the IRSB technique, which relies on calibrating the angular size of Cepheids using their surface brightness and infrared photometry. Testing this technique on simulated and observational data, we find that metallicity has a significant impact on the PL relation, and using a metallicity-dependent calibration can significantly reduce systematic errors in distance measurements. We also find that using the IRSB technique with Cepheids in the LMC can lead to better calibration of the PL relation compared to relying solely on Milky Way Cepheids. The LMC offers a unique opportunity to study Cepheids at a known distance, which can help refine the calibration of the PL relation and reduce uncertainties in cosmic distances. We conclude that the IRSB technique can provide a reliable and accurate calibration of the Cepheid PL relation, and that metallicity and the distance to the LMC should be taken into account when using this technique to calibrate the PL relation for cosmological applications.

      "Inserting test sample 2161  Color-center-hosting semiconductors are emerging as promising source materials for low-field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at or near room temperature, but hyperfine broadening, susceptibility to magnetic field heterogeneity, and nuclear spin relaxation induced by other paramagnetic defects set practical constraints difficult to circumvent. Here, we explore an alternate route to color-center-assisted DNP using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond coupled to substitutional nitrogen impurities, the so-called P1 centers. Working near the level anti-crossing condition - where the P1 Zeeman splitting matches one of the NV spin transitions - we demonstrate efficient microwave-free 13C DNP through the use of consecutive magnetic field sweeps and continuous optical excitation. The amplitude and sign of the polarization can be controlled by adjusting the low-to-high and high-to-low magnetic field sweep rates in each cycle so that one is much faster than the other. By comparing the 13C DNP response for different crystal orientations, we show that the process is robust to magnetic field/NV misalignment, a feature that makes the present technique suitable to diamond powders and settings where the field is heterogeneous. Applications to shallow NVs could capitalize on the greater physical proximity between surface paramagnetic defects and outer nuclei to efficiently polarize target samples in contact with the diamond crystal. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this work, we present a microwave-free approach for DNP in diamond, utilizing an 'integrated' cross effect involving the interplay of electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear spin interactions. We find that coupling the electron spin to multiple nuclear spins results in a significant increase in the DNP efficiency, leading to an enhancement of the nuclear polarization by a factor of up to 700. Our results suggest that this approach could be a promising alternative to conventional DNP in a number of materials applications. To thoroughly understand the mechanism behind the 'integrated' cross effect, we perform EPR, ENDOR, and DNP measurements in diamond particles with systematically varied nitrogen concentration. Our study offers insights into the potential of microwave-free DNP methods in diamond for future material science research.

      "Inserting test sample 2195  The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) scenario was proposed 40 years ago as an evolutionary end state of oxygen-neon white-dwarfs (ONe WDs), linking them to the formation of neutron star (NS) systems. However, there has been no direct detection of any AIC event so far, even though there exists a lot of indirect observational evidence. Meanwhile, the evolutionary pathways resulting in NS formation through AIC are still not well investigated. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor models of AIC events, i.e., the single-degenerate model (including the ONe WD+MS/RG/He star channels and the CO WD+He star channel) and the double-degenerate model (including the double CO/ONe WD channels and the ONe WD+CO WD channel). Recent progress on these progenitor models is reviewed, including the evolutionary scenarios, the initial parameter space and the related objects. For the single-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems could potentially be identified as supersoft X-ray sources, symbiotics and cataclysmic variables, whereas the post-AIC systems could be identified as low-/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries and the resulting low-/intermediate-mass binary pulsars, most notably millisecond pulsars. For the double-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems are close double WDs, whereas the post-AIC systems are isolated NSs with peculiar properties. We also review the predicted rates of AIC events, the mass distribution of NSs, and the gravitational wave (GW) signals from double WDs that are potential GW sources in the Galaxy in the context of future space-based GW detectors. Recent theoretical and observational constraints on the detection of AIC events are summarized.

We show that the metal-superconductor interface can be thought of as an event horizon and Andreev reflection from the interface is analogous to the Hawking radiation in black holes. We describe quantum information transfer in Andreev reflection with a final state projection model similar to the Horowitz-Maldacena model for black hole evaporation. We also propose the Andreev reflection-analogue of Hayden and Preskill's description of a black hole final state, where the black hole is described as an information mirror. The analogy between Crossed Andreev Reflections and Einstein-Rosen bridges is discussed: our proposal gives a precise mechanism for the apparent loss of quantum information in a black hole by the process of nonlocal Andreev reflection, transferring the quantum information through a wormhole and into another universe. Given these established connections, we conjecture that the final quantum state of a black hole is exactly the same as the ground state wavefunction of the superconductor/superfluid in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity; in particular, the infalling matter and the infalling Hawking quanta, described in the Horowitz-Maldacena model, forms a Cooper pair-like singlet state inside the black hole. A black hole evaporating and shrinking in size can be thought of as the analogue of Andreev reflection by a hole where the superconductor loses a Cooper pair.

The polymerization reaction is monitored using several analytical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. We identify that the polymerization process introduces a high degree of structural diversity, which influences the ionic conductivity of the materials. Additionally, we investigate the effect of temperature and ionic strength on the electrical properties of the material. Our results show that the ion diffusion coefficient of the polymerized ionic liquid is affected by both temperature and ionic strength variations. This research highlights the potential of using polymerized ionic liquids for energy applications and as a platform for investigating ion transport and electrochemical behavior in soft materials. The findings presented in this study contribute to the continued development of ionic liquid-based systems and their potential use in energy storage devices. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2247  The effects of line tension on the morphology of a sessile droplet placed on top of a convex spherical substrate are studied. The morphology of the droplet is determined from the global minimum of the Helmholtz free energy. The contact angle between the droplet and the spherical substrate is expressed by the generalized Young's formula. When the line tension is positive and large, the contact angle jumps discontinuously to $180^{\\circ}$, the circular contact line shrinks towards the top of the substrate, and the droplet detaches from the substrate, forming a spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophobic (i.e., the Young's contact angle is large). This finding is consistent with that predicted by Widom [J. Phys. Chem. {\\bf 99}, 2803 (1995)]; the line tension induces a drying transition on a flat substrate. On the other hand, the contact angle jumps to $0^{\\circ}$, the circular contact line shrinks towards the bottom of the substrate, and the droplet spreads over the substrate to form a wrapped spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophilic (i.e., the Young's contact angle is small). Therefore, not only the drying transition of a cap-shaped to a detached spherical droplet but also the wetting transition of a cap-shaped to a wrapped spherical droplet could occur on a spherical substrate as the surface area of the substrate is finite. When the line tension is negative and its magnitude increases, the contact line asymptotically approaches the equator from either above or below. The droplet with a contact line that coincides with the equator is an isolated, singular solution of the first variational problem. In this instance, the contact line is pinned and cannot move as far as the line tension is smaller than the critical magnitude, where the wetting transition occurs. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2248  This study investigates the intricate relationship between the morphology of a sessile droplet and its line tension on a spherical substrate. The line tension is a crucial parameter that governs the droplet's shape and is highly sensitive to the substrate's curvature. In this paper, we present a theoretical model that accounts for the line tension's contribution to the droplet's deformation and subsequent equilibrium. Our model considers the adhesion energy of the droplet, the surface energy of the substrate, and the capillary forces. By varying the line tension and the droplet's contact angle, we explore the droplet's shape for different substrate radii and wettabilities. We find that the droplet's shape transitions from spherical to ellipsoidal as the substrate curvature increases, with the droplet spreading more on hydrophobic substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate that the line tension plays a significant role in determining the droplet's contact angle and its dependence on the substrate radius. Our findings not only shed light on the fundamental physics of wetting and adhesion on curved surfaces, but they are also crucial for a wide range of applications. For instance, understanding the droplet-substrate interaction is essential for designing microfluidic devices, where droplet manipulation is commonly employed. Overall, our results reveal fascinating insights into the complex interplay between line tension and droplet morphology on spherical substrates, with promising implications for various fields of science and engineering. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The generation algorithms are studied to reduce the development cost of a safe fluent API. The study on the generation would benefit a number of programmers since a fluent API is a popular design in the real world.\n",

A generic fluent API refers to the fluent API that provides generic methods (methods that contain type parameters in their definitions). The Stream API in Java is an example of such a generic API. The recent research on the safe fluent API generation rather focuses on the grammar class that the algorithm can deal with for syntax checking. The key idea of the previous study is to use nested generics to represent a stack structure for the parser built on top of the type system. In that idea, the role of a type parameter was limited to internally representing a stack element of that parser on the type system. The library developers could not use type parameters to include a generic method in their API so that the semantic constraints for their API would be statically checked, for example, the type constraint on the items passed through a stream.\n",

Our translation algorithm is modeled as the construction of deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with type parameter information. Each state of the DFA holds information about which type parameters are already bound in that state. This information is used to identify whether a method invocation in a chain newly binds a type to a type parameter, or refers to a previously bound type. The identification is required since a type parameter in a chain is bound at a particular method invocation, and that bound type is referred to in the following method invocations. Our algorithm constructs the DFA by analyzing the binding time of type parameters and their propagation among the states in a DFA that is naively constructed from the given grammar.\n",

These SIDIS asymmetries combined with $e^+e^-$ process asymmetries have allowed for the extraction of $h_1\\left(x\\right)$ and $\\Delta^N D_{\\pi/q^\\uparrow}\\left(z,j_T\\right)$. However, the current uncertainties on $h_1\\left(x\\right)$ are large compared to the corresponding quark momentum and helicity distributions and reflect the limited statistics and kinematic reach of the available data. In transversely polarized hadronic collisions, Collins asymmetries may be isolated and extracted by measuring the spin dependent azimuthal distributions of charged pions in jets. This thesis will report on the first statistically significant Collins asymmetries extracted from $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV hadronic collisions using $14$ pb$^{-1}$ of transversely polarized proton collisions at 57% average polarization. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2274  This paper presents a study of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions in polarized proton collisions through the azimuthal single spin asymmetries (SSAs) of charged pions in jets. The study is conducted using data collected at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The azimuthal SSAs, which measure the difference in the yield of particles produced in the forward direction with respect to the polarized direction of the colliding protons, are sensitive to TMDs and can provide insight into the spin structure of protons. The analysis involves measuring the SSAs of charged pions within identified jets and studying their dependence on the transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and jet axis orientation. The TMDs extracted from the SSAs are compared with theoretical model calculations to test our understanding of TMD factorization and gauge invariance. This work contributes to our understanding of polarized proton structure and offers important information for the interpretation of future high-energy experiments at RHIC and future Electron-Ion Collider experiments. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2275  We study an inverse seesaw model of neutrino mass within the framework of $S_4$ flavour symmetry from the requirement of generating non-zero reactor mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ along with correct dark matter relic abundance. The leading order $S_4$ model gives rise to tri-bimaximal type leptonic mixing resulting in $\\theta_{13}=0$. Non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ is generated at one loop level by extending the model with additional scalar and fermion fields which take part in the loop correction. The particles going inside the loop are odd under an in-built $Z^{\\text{Dark}}_2$ symmetry such that the lightest $Z^{\\text{Dark}}_2$ odd particle can be a dark matter candidate. Correct neutrino and dark matter phenomenology can be achieved for such one loop corrections either to the light neutrino mass matrix or to the charged lepton mass matrix although the latter case is found to be more predictive. The predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay is also discussed and inverted hierarchy in the charged lepton correction case is found to be disfavoured by the latest KamLAND-Zen data. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Additionally, one of the triplets produces a Tiny Viable Seesaw (TVS) mechanism which provides the smallness of neutrino masses dictated by current observation. The second triplet generates a radiative charged lepton mass hierarchy and, in the meantime, accommodates a dark matter particle. We impose a $Z_2$ symmetry to stabilize the dark matter candidate and ensure its particle nature. With the identified new scalars and right-handed neutrinos, the model provides an efficient mechanism to solve the long-standing problems of neutrino mass and the existence of dark matter.

      "Inserting test sample 2277  We present Voxel Transformer (VoTr), a novel and effective voxel-based Transformer backbone for 3D object detection from point clouds. Conventional 3D convolutional backbones in voxel-based 3D detectors cannot efficiently capture large context information, which is crucial for object recognition and localization, owing to the limited receptive fields. In this paper, we resolve the problem by introducing a Transformer-based architecture that enables long-range relationships between voxels by self-attention. Given the fact that non-empty voxels are naturally sparse but numerous, directly applying standard Transformer on voxels is non-trivial. To this end, we propose the sparse voxel module and the submanifold voxel module, which can operate on the empty and non-empty voxel positions effectively. To further enlarge the attention range while maintaining comparable computational overhead to the convolutional counterparts, we propose two attention mechanisms for multi-head attention in those two modules: Local Attention and Dilated Attention, and we further propose Fast Voxel Query to accelerate the querying process in multi-head attention. VoTr contains a series of sparse and submanifold voxel modules and can be applied in most voxel-based detectors. Our proposed VoTr shows consistent improvement over the convolutional baselines while maintaining computational efficiency on the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

However, detecting objects in 3D space is a complex and computationally expensive task due to the size and complexity of the data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for 3D object detection using a voxel transformer. Our method takes a 3D point cloud as input and transforms it into a high-dimensional voxel representation using a transformer network. The transformer network learns to attend to different regions of the input point cloud and encode them into feature vectors. These features are then fed into a detection head to predict the 3D bounding boxes and object categories. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset for both 3D object detection and bird's eye view object detection tasks. The voxel transformer also has a compact representation and requires less memory than previous methods.

We are given $n$ stations out of which at most $d$ are active and intend to transmit a message to other stations using MAC. All stations are assumed to be synchronized according to a time clock. If $l$ stations node transmit in the same round, then the MAC provides the feedback whether $l=0$, $l=2$ (collision occurred) or $l=1$. When $l=1$, then a single station is indeed able to successfully transmit a message, which is received by all other nodes.

We analyze the performance of various existing MAC protocols and propose a new algorithm to improve the fairness and efficiency of conflict resolution. Our proposed algorithm is based on a joint optimization of channel access probability and contention window size, which allows for an adaptive adjustment of the access probability for nodes with different levels of contention. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm using simulations in different network scenarios.

When fg decreases (increases), the gas fraction in the halo typically increases (decreases), showing that the SN driven outflows play an important role in regulating the gas fractions -and hence the SFR- of the dwarfs.

Our results demonstrate that the star formation efficiency of dwarf galaxies is strongly influenced by the mass assembly history of their host dark matter halos.

Furthermore, we find that the central density profiles of these dwarf galaxies are highly correlated with the density profiles of their host dark matter halos.

      "Inserting test sample 2283  Realized statistics based on high frequency returns have become very popular in financial economics. In recent years, different non-parametric estimators of the variation of a log-price process have appeared. These were developed by many authors and were motivated by the existence of complete records of price data. Among them are the realized quadratic (co-)variation which is perhaps the most well known example, providing a consistent estimator of the integrated (co-)volatility when the logarithmic price process is continuous.

At the position of the Herschel emission, three blobs are detected with the VLA at 10cm. The CO(5-4) line detection of each blob confirms that they are at the same redshift with the same line width, indicating that they are multiple images of the same source. In Spitzer and deep optical observations, two sources, High-z Lens 1 (HL1) West and HL1 East, are detected at the center of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs. These two sources are placed at z=1.48 with XSHOOTER spectra, suggesting that they could be merging and gravitationally lensing the emission of RV4. HL1 is the second most distant lens known to date in strong lensing systems. The Einstein radius of the lensing system is 2.2\"+/-0.2 (20kpc). The high redshift of HL1 and the large Einstein radius are highly unusual for a strong lensing system. We present the ISM properties of the background source RV4. Different estimates of the gas depletion time yield low values suggesting that RV4 is a SB galaxy. Among all high-z SMGs, this source exhibits one of the lowest L$_{[CI]}$ to L$_{IR}$ ratios, 3.2+/-0.9x10$^{-6}$, suggesting an extremely short gas tdepl of only 14+/-5Myr.

Finally, we discuss that the short tdepl of RV4 can be explained by either a very high SFE, which is difficult to reconcile with major mergers simulations of high-z galaxies, or a rapid decrease of SF, which would bias the estimate of tdepl toward low value. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this paper, we analyze AGH using data analysis,statistics, discrete mathematics, and deep learning techniques to process the data to controlAGH spreading.First, we visualize the geographical distribution of insects in Washington State. Then we investigate insect populations to varying months of the year and different days of a month.Third, we employ wavelet analysis to examine the periodic spread of AGH. Fourth, we apply ordinary differential equations to examine AGH numbers at the different natural growthrate and reaction speed and output the potential propagation coefficient. Next, we leverage cellular automaton combined with the potential propagation coefficient to simulate the geographical spread under changing potential propagation. To update the model, we use delayed differential equations to simulate human intervention. We use the time difference between detection time and submission time to determine the unit of time to delay time. After that, we construct a lightweight CNN called SqueezeNet and assess its classification performance. We then relate several non-reference image quality metrics, including NIQE, image gradient, entropy, contrast, and TOPSIS to judge the cause of misclassification. Furthermore, we build a Random Forest classifier to identify positive and negative samples based on image qualities only. We also display the feature importance and conduct an error analysis. Besides, we present sensitivity analysis to verify the robustness of our models. Finally, we show the strengths and weaknesses of our model and derives the conclusions. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Trains of strongly nonlinear solitary waves were excited by an impact. A significant modification of the signal shape and an increase of solitary wave speed up to two times (at the same amplitude of dynamic contact force)were achieved through a noncontact magnetically induced precompression of the chains.

(3) The rotational axes of both BSs will be aligned with each other and the orbital plane of the outer tertiary WD. (4) The BSs will have roughly equal masses, independent of their initial masses (since the lower mass star accretes the most). The dominant accretor should, therefore, be more enriched by the accreted material. Hence, one of the BSs will appear to be more enriched by either He, C and O or by s-process elements, if the donor started Roche lobe overflow on, respectively, the red giant or asymptotic giant branch.

Our radio data reveal a two sided structure, with symmetric S-shaped jets emerging from a flat spectrum core. We fit the jet brightness with gaussian components, which we identify from a previous observation taken five years before. By comparing the positions of the components in the two epochs, we measure motions between 0.45 +/- 0.14 and 3.76 +/- 0.65 mas, corresponding to apparent velocities < 0.2c, and to ages in the range 8.3 - 65.8 years. Assuming that the radio morphology is intrinsically symmetric and its appearance is governed by Doppler beaming effects, we find that NGC4278 has mildly relativistic jets (beta ~ 0.75), closely aligned to the line-of-sight (2 degrees < theta < 4 degrees). Alternatively, the source could be oriented at a larger angle and asymmetries could be related to the jet interaction with the surrounding medium. We also present new simultaneous VLA observations between 1.4 and 43 GHz, and a 5 GHz light curve between 1972 and 2003. The radio spectrum can be fit by a relatively steep power-law (alpha = 0.54).

However, adversarial results obtained by these methods typically contain point outliers, which are both noticeable and easy to defend against using the simple techniques of outlier removal. Motivated by the different mechanisms by which humans perceive 2D images and 3D shapes, in this paper we propose the new design of \\emph{geometry-aware objectives}, whose solutions favor (the discrete versions of) the desired surface properties of smoothness and fairness. To generate adversarial point clouds, we use a targeted attack misclassification loss that supports continuous pursuit of increasingly malicious signals. Regularizing the targeted attack loss with our proposed geometry-aware objectives results in our proposed method, Geometry-Aware Adversarial Attack ($GeoA^3$). The results of $GeoA^3$ tend to be more harmful, arguably harder to defend against, and of the key adversarial characterization of being imperceptible to humans.

      "Inserting test sample 2323  This work introduces a novel estimation method, called LOVE, of the entries and structure of a loading matrix A in a sparse latent factor model X = AZ + E, for an observable random vector X in Rp, with correlated unobservable factors Z \\in RK, with K unknown, and independent noise E. Each row of A is scaled and sparse. In order to identify the loading matrix A, we require the existence of pure variables, which are components of X that are associated, via A, with one and only one latent factor. Despite the fact that the number of factors K, the number of the pure variables, and their location are all unknown, we only require a mild condition on the covariance matrix of Z, and a minimum of only two pure variables per latent factor to show that A is uniquely defined, up to signed permutations. Our proofs for model identifiability are constructive, and lead to our novel estimation method of the number of factors and of the set of pure variables, from a sample of size n of observations on X. This is the first step of our LOVE algorithm, which is optimization-free, and has low computational complexity of order p2. The second step of LOVE is an easily implementable linear program that estimates A. We prove that the resulting estimator is minimax rate optimal up to logarithmic factors in p. The model structure is motivated by the problem of overlapping variable clustering, ubiquitous in data science. We define the population level clusters as groups of those components of X that are associated, via the sparse matrix A, with the same unobservable latent factor, and multi-factor association is allowed.\n",

In this way, sensitive data does not leave the user devices. FL uses the FedAvg algorithm, which is trained in the iterative model averaging way, on the non-iid and unbalanced distributed data, without depending on the data quantity. Some issues with the FL are, 1) no scalability, as the model is iteratively trained over all the devices, which amplifies with device drops; 2) security and privacy trade-off of the learning process still not robust enough and 3) overall communication efficiency and the cost are higher. To mitigate these challenges we present Federated Learning and Privately Scaling (FLaPS) architecture, which improves scalability as well as the security and privacy of the system. The devices are grouped into clusters which further gives better privacy scaled turn around time to finish a round of training. Therefore, even if a device gets dropped in the middle of training, the whole process can be started again after a definite amount of time.

Based on the well-defined TOUGH sample of 69 X-ray selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs known from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range 1.8-4.5. We detect Lya emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting 3sigma line flux being 8E-18 erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a Lya luminosity of 6E41 erg/s at z=3. The Lya luminosities for the 7 hosts in which we detect Lya emission are in the range (0.6-2.3)E42 erg/s corresponding to star-formation rates of 0.6-2.1 Msun/yr (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Lya equivalent widths (EWs) for the 7 hosts are in the range 9-40A. For 6 of the 13 hosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits on the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less constraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Lya EWs is inconsistent with being drawn from the Lya EW distribution of bright Lyman break galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average have larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on a smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are Lya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the pre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92% level. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly indicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems to be a trend between the Lya EW and the optical to X-ray spectral index of the afterglow (beta_OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength and even presence of Lya emission.

The $<V/V_{\\rm max}>$ of the long bursts is $ 0.2901\\pm 0.0113$, and that of the short bursts is $0.4178\\pm 0.0239$, which is a Euclidean value. For luminosity function models, we consider a cylindrical-beam and a conic-beam. We take into account the spatial distribution of GRB sources as well. A broad luminosity function is naturally produced when one introduces beaming of GRBs. We calculate the maximum detectable redshift of GRBs, $z_{\\rm max}$. The estimated $z_{\\rm max}$ for the cylindrical-beam case is as high as $\\sim 14$ for the long bursts and $\\sim 3$ for the short bursts. The large $z_{\\rm max}$ value for the short bursts is rather surprising in that the $<V/V_{\\rm max}>$ for this subgroup is close to the so-called Euclidean value, 0.5. We calculate the fraction of bursts whose redshifts are larger than a certain redshift $z'$, i.e. $f_{\\rm > z'}$.

      "Inserting test sample 2363  There are two major routes to address the ubiquitous family of inverse problems appearing in signal and image processing, such as denoising or deblurring. A first route relies on Bayesian modeling, where prior probabilities are used to embody models of both the distribution of the unknown variables and their statistical dependence with the observed data. The estimation process typically relies on the minimization of an expected loss (e.g. minimum mean squared error, or MMSE). The second route has received much attention in the context of sparse regularization and compressive sensing: it consists in designing (often convex) optimization problems involving the sum of a data fidelity term and a penalty term promoting certain types of unknowns (e.g., sparsity, promoted through an 1 norm). Well known relations between these two approaches have lead to some widely spread misconceptions. In particular, while the so-called Maximum A Posterori (MAP) estimate with a Gaussian noise model does lead to an optimization problem with a quadratic data-fidelity term, we disprove through explicit examples the common belief that the converse would be true. It has already been shown [7, 9] that for denoising in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, for any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can be expressed as a penalized least squares problem, with the apparent characteristics of a MAP estimation problem with Gaussian noise and a (generally) different prior on the unknowns. In other words, the variational approach is rich enough to build all possible MMSE estimators associated to additive Gaussian noise via a well chosen penalty. We generalize these results beyond Gaussian denoising and characterize noise models for which the same phenomenon occurs. In particular, we prove that with (a variant of) Poisson noise and any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can again be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares optimization problem. For additive scalar denois-ing the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise distribution is log-concave. In particular, Laplacian denoising can (perhaps surprisingly) be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares problem. In the multivariate case, the same phenomenon occurs when the noise model belongs to a particular subset of the exponential family. For multivariate additive denoising, the phenomenon holds if and only if the noise is white and Gaussian. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

For this purpose, several GO samples having different concentrations of epoxide and hydroxyl functional groups are considered. The results reveal that increasing the epoxide coverage causes a noticeable deterioration in the mechanical characteristics of GO systems. This change is correlated with the increase of the formation of ripples in the structure upon increasing the epoxide coverage. Moreover, investigating the bond lengths in the system, it is concluded that the higher epoxide percentage leads to an increase in the length of single and hybrid resonance bonds leading to an overall deterioration of the mechanical properties of GO samples. Additionally, our results demonstrate that high concentration of functional groups can lead to a negative Poisson ratio. Increasing the amount of hydroxyl groups shows the same declining effect on the Young modulus.

In this cascade scenario, PBM-based estimates of propensities are not accurate, which, in turn, hurts CLTR performance. In this paper, we propose a propensity estimation method for the cascade scenario, called CM-IPS.

      "Inserting test sample 2377  The existence of the QCD critical point at non-zero baryon density is not only of great interest for experimental physics but also a challenge for the theory. Any hint of the existence of the first order phase transition and, particularly, its critical point will be valuable towards a full understanding of the QCD phase diagram. We use lattice simulation based on the canonical ensemble method to explore the finite baryon density and finite temperature region and look for the QCD critical point. As a benchmark, we run simulations for the four degenerate flavor QCD where we observe a clear signal of the expected first order phase transition. In the two flavor case, we do not see any signal for temperatures as low as $0.83 \\rm{T_c}$. Although our real world contains two light quarks and one heavier quark, three degenerate flavor case shares a lot of similar phase structures as the QCD.

      "Inserting test sample 2379  Ordinarily, quiver varieties are constructed as moduli spaces of quiver representations in the category of vector spaces. It is also natural to consider quiver representations in a richer category, namely that of vector bundles on some complex variety equipped with a fixed sheaf that twists the morphisms. Representations of A-type quivers in this twisted category --- known in the literature as \"holomorphic chains\" --- have practical use in questions concerning the topology of the moduli space of Higgs bundles. In that problem, the variety is a Riemann surface of genus at least 2, and the twist is its canonical line bundle. We extend the treatment of twisted A-type quiver representations to any genus using the Hitchin stability condition induced by Higgs bundles and computing their deformation theory. We then focus in particular on so-called \"argyle quivers\", where the rank labelling alternates between 1 and integers $r_i\\geq1$. We give explicit geometric identifications of moduli spaces of twisted representations of argyle quivers on $\\mathbb{P}^1$ using invariant theory for a non-reductive action via Euclidean reduction on polynomials. This leads to a stratification of the moduli space by change of bundle type, which we identify with \"collision manifolds\" of invariant zeroes of polynomials. We also relate the present work to Bradlow-Daskalopoulos stability and Thaddeus' pullback maps to stable tuples.

We further compare the evolution of the toroidal flux with that of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites soft X-ray flux and find that they are basically synchronous in time, except that the peak of the former is somewhat delayed. The results suggest that the toroidal flux of the CME flux rope may be first quickly built up by the reconnection mainly taking place in the sheared overlying field and then reduced by the reconnection among the twisted field lines within the flux rope, as enlightened by a recent 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation of CMEs. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 2409  Recently, it has been discovered that systems of Active Brownian particles (APB) at high density organise their velocities into coherent domains showing large spatial structures in the velocity field. Such a collective behavior occurs spontaneously, i.e. is not caused by any specific interparticle force favoring the alignment of the velocities. This phenomenon was investigated in the absence of thermal noise and in the overdamped regime where inertial forces could be neglected. In this work, we demonstrate through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis that the velocity alignment is a robust property of ABP and persists even in the presence of inertial forces and thermal fluctuations. We also show that a single dimensionless parameter, such as the P\\'eclet number customarily employed in the description of self-propelled particles, is not sufficient to fully characterize such a phenomenon neither in the regimes of large viscosity nor small mass. Indeed, the size of the velocity domains, measured through the correlation length of the spatial velocity correlation, remains constant when the swim velocity increases while decreases as the rotational diffusion becomes larger. We find that the spatial velocity correlation depends on the inertia but, contrary to common belief, are non-symmetrically affected by mass and inverse viscosity variations. We conclude that in self-propelled systems, at variance with passive systems, variations of the inertial time (mass over solvent viscosity) and mass act as independent control parameters. Finally, we highlight the non-thermal nature of the spatial velocity correlations that are fairly insensitive both to solvent and active temperatures. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2410  This research paper investigates the spatial velocity correlations in inertial systems of Active Brownian Particles (ABP). ABPs are self-propelled particles that exhibit both Brownian motion and active motion. The active motion arises due to the intrinsic energy of ABPs, which is converted into directed motion. The Brownian motion arises due to the stochastic interaction of ABPs with the solvent molecules. Through computer simulations, we explore the velocity correlations of ABPs in inertial systems and compare them with those in non-inertial systems. We find that the velocity correlations in inertial systems depend on the particle's swimming speed, while in non-inertial systems, they depend on the particle's rotational diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the correlations in inertial systems are anisotropic and depend on the angle between the relative positions and velocities of the particles. We also investigate the effects of the hydrodynamic interactions among ABPs in these systems. Our results show that the correlations can be enhanced or suppressed by the hydrodynamic interactions, depending on their strengths and the swimming speed of the ABPs. These findings have implications for understanding the collective behavior of ABPs in real-world systems, such as bacterial suspensions and self-propelled colloidal particles, and can potentially lead to the development of new technologies based on active matter. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The star formation properties of isolated and non-isolated galaxies in this sample were studied by using the H-alpha indicator from a number of spectroscopic surveys. Our results suggest a clear correlation between the structural properties of galaxies and their star formation activity. Specifically, we find a strong decrease in H-alpha emission in central regions of bulge-dominated galaxies, which indicates that bulges are capable of inhibiting star formation in their host galaxies. We also show that the fraction of disk-dominated galaxies with high star formation activity increases with decreasing bulge-to-disk ratio. Moreover, we find that the transition from bulge-dominated to disk-dominated systems is associated with a sharp increase in star formation activity.

In this paper I study the problem in proper terms of lepton and quark Deviation-from-Mass-Degeneracy (DMD) hierarchies at tree EW approximation. As primary are considered not discrete flavor symmetry but rather the deviations from mass-degeneracy-symmetry without inventing exact particular symmetry. Empirically suggested benchmark flavor patterns (zero approximation) and deviations from benchmarks caused by emergence of a small related to EW charges parameter are considered two sources of realistic flavor quantities. Physically interesting mass and mixing flavor quantities are obtained as solutions of linear and quadratic DMD-hierarchy equation-pairs with complementary patterns of quark and lepton DMD-hierarchies. Dual relations between DMD-quantities of quarks and charged leptons (Dirac particles), on the one hand, and neutrinos (likely Majorana particles), on the other hand, are inferences. Considered in the literature approximate quark-neutrino mixing angle complementarity appears naturally from the violation of benchmark patterns by the emergent small parameter. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 2439  We present results of a programme of multi-epoch, intra-night optical monitoring of a sample of non-blazar type AGN, which includes seven radio-quiet QSOs (RQQs) and an equal number of radio-loud, lobe-dominated quasars (LDQs), covering a redshift range from about 0.2 to 2.0. These two sets of optically bright and intrinsically luminous QSOs are well matched in the redshift-optical luminosity ($z - M_B$) plane. Our CCD monitoring covered a total of 61 nights with an average of 6.1 hours of densely sampled monitoring of just a single QSO per night, thereby achieving a typical detection threshold of $\\sim 1$% variation over the night. Unambiguous detection of intra-night variability(INOV) amplitudes in the range 1$-$3% on day-like or shorter time scales were thus made for both RQQs and LDQs. Based on these clear detections of INOV, we estimate duty cycles of 17% and 9% for RQQs and LDQs, respectively; inclusion of the two cases of probable variations of LDQs would raise the duty cycle to 15% for LDQs. The similarity in the duty cycle and amplitude of INOV for the RQQs and LDQs suggests, firstly, that the radio loudness alone does not guarantee an enhanced INOV in QSOs and,secondly, that as in LDQs, relativistic jets may also be present in RQQs. We argue that, as compared to BL Lacs, the conspicuously milder, rarer and possibly slower INOV of RQQs and LDQs, can in fact be readily understood in terms of their having optical synchrotron jets which are modestly misaligned from us,but are otherwise intrinsically as relativistic and active as the jets in BL Lacs. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

However, natural and human-related activities can degrade water quality, leading to pollution and harmful algal blooms. One way to mitigate these risks is through the use of water surface cleaning bots equipped with advanced sensors that detect pollutants like microplastics and oil spills. The use of such devices ensures that water bodies maintain their natural state and are not a threat to the ecosystem or human well-being. In addition, a water body surveillance system that continuously monitors water quality in both rural and urban areas is of utmost importance. This system can integrate various remote sensors, digital imaging, and computing technologies to detect water quality and notify relevant environmental agencies when water becomes contaminated. In situations where water is also used for drinking purposes, the surveillance system can provide near-instantaneous real-time alerts to enable the necessary steps to be taken to prevent an outbreak of waterborne diseases.\n",

This paper focuses on the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) obtained in 2017 February-March, when GRS 1716-249 was in a bright hard spectral state. The soft gamma-ray data collected with the INTEGRAL/SPI telescope show the presence of a spectral component which is in excess of the thermal Comptonisation emission.

The best-fit parameters are typical of the bright hard state spectra observed in other black hole X-ray binaries. Moreover, the magnetised hybrid Comptonisation model BELM provides an upper limit on the intensity of the coronal magnetic field of about 1E+06 G.

We use the self-consistent nuclear density functional theory (DFT) with Skyrme energy density functionals and covariance analysis to assess correlations between observables for finite nuclei and neutron stars. In a first step two energy functionals -- a high density energy functional giving reasonable neutron properties, and a low density functional fitted to nuclear properties -- are matched. In a second step, we optimize a new functional using exactly the same protocol as in earlier studies pertaining to nuclei but now including neutron star data. This allows direct comparisons of performance of the new functional relative to the standard one.

M63 is a remarkable example of a spiral galaxy with one of the most extended UV disks, so it offers the opportunity to search for the molecular gas and characterize the star formation in outer disk regions as revealed by the UV emission. We obtained deep CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations on the IRAM 30 m telescope along the major axis of the M63 disk from the center out to the galactocentric radius rgal = 1.6 r25 and over a bright UV region at rgal = 1.36 r25. CO(1-0) is detected all along the M63 major axis out to r25, and CO(2-1) is confined to rgal = 0.68 r25, which may betray lower excitation temperatures in the outer disk. CO(1-0) is also detected in the external bright UV region of M63. The radial profiles of the CO emission and of the Halpha, 24 micron, NUV and FUV star formation tracers and HI taken from the literature show a severe drop with the galactocentric radius, such that beyond r25 they are all absent with the exception of a faint UV emission and HI. The CO emission detection in the external UV region, where the UV flux is higher than the UV flux observed beyond r25, highlights a tight correlation between the CO and UV fluxes, namely the amount of molecular gas and the intensity of star formation. This external UV region is dominated by the atomic gas, suggesting that HI is more likely the precursor of H2 rather than the product of UV photodissociation.

There are two existing general methods: tangent space PCA and geodesic PCA. However, unlike tangent space PCA, our torus-PCA honors the cyclic topology of the data space whereas, unlike geodesic PCA, our torus-PCA produces a variety of non-winding, non-dense descriptors. This is achieved by deforming tori into spheres and then using a variant of the recently developed principle nested spheres analysis. This PCA analysis involves a step of small sphere fitting and we provide an improved test to avoid overfitting. However, deforming tori into spheres creates singularities. We introduce a data-adaptive pre-clustering technique to keep the singularities away from the data. For the frequently encountered case that the residual variance around the PCA main component is small, we use a post-mode hunting technique for more fine-grained clustering.

Using Floquet theory for an effective two-level system, we solve the related time-dependent scattering problem, beyond the standard rotating-wave approximation approach, for a plane Dirac-photon wave hitting a cylindrical oscillating barrier that couples the radiation field to the vibrational degrees of freedom. We demonstrate different scattering regimes and discuss the formation of polaritonic quasiparticles. We show that sideband-scattering becomes important when the energies of the sidebands are located in the vicinity of avoided crossings of the quasienergy bands. The interference of Floquet states belonging to different sidebands causes a mixing of long-wavelength (quantum) and short-wavelength (quasiclassical) behavior, making it possible to use the oscillating quantum dot as a kind of transistor for light and sound. We comment under which conditions the setup can be utilized to observe zitterbewegung. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

By conducting a detailed analysis of the scattering matrix, we find that the system exhibits interesting effects related to the violation of parity symmetry, as well as the generation of higher-order sidebands.

      "Inserting test sample 2525  The pros and cons of various forms of atomism and holism that are applicable both in physical science and today's philosophy of nature are evaluated. To this end, Lewis' thesis of Humean supervenience is presented as an important case study of an atomistic doctrine in philosophical thought. According to the thesis of Humean supervenience, the world is fragmented into local matters of particular fact and everything else supervenes upon them in conjunction with the spatiotemporal relations among them. It is explicitly shown that Lewis' ontological doctrine of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the so-called separability principle of classical physics. In view of the systematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, it is argued that contemporary physical science posits non-supervenient relations over and above the spatiotemporal ones. It is demonstrated that the relation of quantum entanglement constitutes the prototypical example of a holistic, irreducible physical relation that does not supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of Humean qualities, undermining, thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It is concluded, in this respect, that the assumption of ontological reductionism, as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a reliable code of the nature of the physical world and its contents. It is proposed instead that - due to the undeniable existence of generic non-supervenient relations - a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be acknowledged as an indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world at a fundamental level. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2526  This paper explores the debate between atomism and holism in both science and philosophy. Atomism is the belief that reality can be understood by breaking it down into its smallest parts, while holism states that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The history of this debate is traced from the ancient Greek atomists to modern-day philosophers of science. The paper argues that both atomism and holism have their strengths and weaknesses in scientific and philosophical inquiry. On one hand, atomism provides a reductionist approach that often leads to breakthroughs in scientific knowledge, such as the discovery of the structure of DNA. On the other hand, holism recognizes the complex interactions and interdependencies within systems, which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of phenomena like ecosystems or economies. The paper concludes that both atomism and holism are valuable perspectives in scientific and philosophical research, and that a balance between the two is necessary for a fuller understanding of the world around us.

The fraction of time associated with CSIT state I_1I_2 is denoted by the parameter \\lambda_{I_1I_2} and it is assumed throughout that \\lambda_{I_1I_2}=\\lambda_{I_2I_1}, i.e., \\lambda_{PN}=\\lambda_{NP}, \\lambda_{PD}=\\lambda_{DP}, \\lambda_{DN}=\\lambda_{ND}. Under this assumption of symmetry, the main contribution of this paper is a complete characterization of the DoF region of the two user MISO BC with alternating CSIT.

From a symmetry point of view, nematic order can be described as a coherent locking of spin fluctuations in two interpenetrating N\\'eel sublattices with ensuing nearest-neighbor bond order and an absence of static magnetism. Here, we argue that the low-temperature state of the recently discovered superconductor BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O is a strong candidate for a more exotic form of spin-driven nematic order, in which fluctuations occurring in four N\\'eel sublattices promote both nearest- and next-nearest neighbor bond order. We develop a low-energy field theory of this state and show that it can have, as a function of temperature, up to two separate bond-order phase transitions -- namely, one that breaks rotation symmetry and one that breaks reflection and translation symmetries of the lattice. The resulting state has an orthorhombic lattice distortion, an intra-unit-cell charge density wave, and no long-range magnetic order, all consistent with reported measurements of the low-temperature phase of BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O.

Such effect takes place when the spins of the binary members are misaligned with respect to the orbital angular momentum. As a first step we assess the importance of precession specifically for the first-generation of LIGO detectors. We investigate the extent of the signal-to-noise ratio reduction and, hence, detection rate that occurs when precession effects are not accounted for in the template waveforms. We restrict our analysis to binary systems that undergo the so-called simple precession and have a total mass close to 10 solar mass. We find that for binary systems with rather high mass ratios (e.g., a 1.4 solar mass neutron star and a 10 solar mass black hole) the detection rate can decrease by almost an order of magnitude. Current astrophysical estimates of the rate of binary inspiral events suggest that LIGO could detect at most a few events per year, and therefore the reduction of the detection rate even by a factor of a few is critical. In the second part of our analysis, we examine whether the effect of precession could be included in the templates by capturing the main features of the phase modulation through a small number of extra parameters. Specifically we examine and tested for the first time the 3-parameter family suggested by Apostolatos. We find that, even though these ``mimic'' templates improve the detection rate, they are still inadequate in recovering the signal-to-noise ratio at the desired level.

We report on the observation of a fast relaxation of hot carriers, which is attributed to electron-phonon scattering and is found to be independent of temperature. In addition, we find evidence for carrier recombination at defect sites, with decay times in the nanosecond range. The observed dynamics are consistent with a model involving the interplay of surface states and bulk impurities. Our results provide important insights into the fundamental properties of topological insulators and can guide the development of future devices based on these materials. The ultrafast time scale of carrier dynamics opens up new possibilities for novel ultrafast optoelectronic applications. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",

The $k$-server problem consists of maintaining $k$ servers on a network in order to minimize the cost of service requests.

We first introduce a one-step lookahead algorithm for the classical $k$-server problem that utilizes a dynamic programming approach. The algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O(log k)/log log k and provides a guarantee that the cost of our solution is within a constant factor of the optimal. Next, we present a quantum algorithm for the same problem, which has polynomial time complexity and delivers an exponential improvement over the best known classical algorithm. Our algorithm utilizes a quantum walk framework, which enhances classical random walk algorithms by exploiting quantum parallelism.

BEAMS is a Bayesian framework for using data from multiple species in statistical inference when one has the probability that each data point belongs to a given species, corresponding in this context to different types of supernovae with their probabilities derived from their multi-band lightcurves. We run the BEAMS algorithm on both Gaussian and more realistic SNANA simulations with of order 10^4 supernovae, testing the algorithm against various pitfalls one might expect in the new and somewhat uncharted territory of photometric supernova cosmology. We compare the performance of BEAMS to that of both mock spectroscopic surveys and photometric samples which have been cut using typical selection criteria. The latter typically are either biased due to contamination or have significantly larger contours in the cosmological parameters due to small data-sets.

The trend is independent of the redshift range, the optical and radio flux selection limits, or the exact definition of a radio match.

We do find, however, that those quasars identified as AI-BALQSOs but \\emph{not} under the classical definition, do not show a significant drop in their fraction as a function of radio power, further supporting independent claims for which these sources, characterized by lower equivalent width, may represent an independent class with respect to the classical BALQSOs. We find the balnicity index, a measure of the absorption trough in BALQSOs, and the mean maximum wind velocity to be roughly constant at all radio powers.

Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that the low-frequency, non-zonal flow is quite geostrophic (columnar) and predominantly large-scale: an m=1 eddy spontaneously emerges in our most extreme simulations, without any heterogeneous boundary forcing.Our spatio-temporal analysis further reveals that (i) the low-frequency, large-scale flow is governed by a balance between Coriolis and buoyancy forces -- magnetic field and flow tend to align, minimizing the Lorentz force; (ii) the high-frequency flow obeys a balance between magnetic and Coriolis forces; (iii) the convective plumes mostly live at an intermediate scale, whose dynamics is driven by a 3-term 1 MAC balance -- involving Coriolis, Lorentz and buoyancy forces. However, small-scale (E^{1/3}) quasi-geostrophic convection is still observed in the regions of low magnetic intensity. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In order to understand the impact of AGN on their host galaxies, it is imperative to investigate the properties of the outflows they launch. PDS 456 is an ideal candidate for studying AGN feedback due to its extreme luminosity and the presence of a kpc-scale molecular outflow. In this work, we present observations of PDS 456 made with ALMA that allow us to study the molecular gas in the outflow. We detect two components in the outflow, a higher velocity, faster-moving component and a lower velocity, slower-moving component. These two components may be related to the different ways in which the outflow interacts with the surrounding medium. The faster-moving component may be caused by a direct interaction with the interstellar medium or by the interaction of a warm wind with a cooler, denser medium. The slower-moving component may be caused by entrainment of cold gas from the host galaxy. Our results suggest that PDS 456 has a substantial impact on its host galaxy. The outflow is likely to drive significant turbulence in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, which could eventually lead to the suppression of star formation. Our findings highlight the importance of studying AGN feedback at kpc scales and provide new insights into the physical processes taking place in the AGN environment.

      "Inserting test sample 2605  In this paper, we consider a surrogate modeling approach using a data-driven nonparametric likelihood function constructed on a manifold on which the data lie (or to which they are close). The proposed method represents the likelihood function using a spectral expansion formulation known as the kernel embedding of the conditional distribution. To respect the geometry of the data, we employ this spectral expansion using a set of data-driven basis functions obtained from the diffusion maps algorithm. The theoretical error estimate suggests that the error bound of the approximate data-driven likelihood function is independent of the variance of the basis functions, which allows us to determine the amount of training data for accurate likelihood function estimations. Supporting numerical results to demonstrate the robustness of the data-driven likelihood functions for parameter estimation are given on instructive examples involving stochastic and deterministic differential equations. When the dimension of the data manifold is strictly less than the dimension of the ambient space, we found that the proposed approach (which does not require the knowledge of the data manifold) is superior compared to likelihood functions constructed using standard parametric basis functions defined on the ambient coordinates. In an example where the data manifold is not smooth and unknown, the proposed method is more robust compared to an existing polynomial chaos surrogate model which assumes a parametric likelihood, the non-intrusive spectral projection. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Our framework is able to capture complex dependencies between the data and the parameters, which results in improved parameter estimation performance compared to existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a set of synthetic and real datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability.

In this paper, we apply the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model to the CCFs between the RASS Broad-line AGNs with SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) in the redshift range 0.16<z<0.36 that was calculated in paper I. In our HOD modeling approach, we use the known HOD of LRGs and constrain the HOD of the AGNs by a model fit to the CCF. For the first time, we are able to go beyond quoting merely a `typical' AGN host halo mass, M_h, and model the full distribution function of AGN host dark matter halos. In addition, we are able to determine the large-scale bias and the mean M_h more accurately. We explore the behavior of three simple HOD models. Our first model (Model A) is a truncated power-law HOD model in which all AGNs are satellites. With this model, we find an upper limit to the slope (\\alpha) of the AGN HOD that is far below unity. The other two models have a central component, which has a step function form, where the HOD is constant above a minimum mass, without (Model B) or with (Model C) an upper mass cutoff, in addition to the truncated power-law satellite component, similar to the HOD that is found for galaxies.\n",

These spectra are combined with optical and near-infrared photometry of each RCB at maximum light to compile a spectral energy distribution (SED). The SEDs are fitted with blackbody flux distributions and estimates made of the ratio of the infrared flux from circumstellar dust to the flux emitted by the star. Comparisons for 29 of the 31 stars are made with the IRAS fluxes from three decades earlier: Spitzer and IRAS fluxes at 12 um and 25 um are essentially equal for all but a minority of the sample. For this minority, the IRAS to Spitzer flux ratio exceeds a factor of three. The outliers are suggested to be stars where formation of a dust cloud or dust puff is a rare event. A single puff ejected prior to the IRAS observations may have been reobserved by Spitzer as a cooler puff at a greater distance from the RCB. RCBs which experience more frequent optical declines have, in general, a circumstellar environment containing puffs subtending a larger solid angle at the star and a quasi-constant infrared flux. Yet, the estimated subtended solid angles and the blackbody temperatures of the dust show a systematic evolution to lower solid angles and cooler temperatures in the interval between IRAS and Spitzer.

The mid-infrared spectra obtained with Spitzer reveal the presence of prominent emission features from amorphous and crystalline silicates, carbonates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the immediate vicinity of the stars. The dust grains are characterized by a wide range of sizes, from a few to hundreds of nanometers, and are mostly distributed in a flattened geometry, consistent with the expectation of a circumstellar disk or torus. Some of the RCB stars exhibit additional spectral features, such as broad absorption bands from hydrogenated amorphous carbon or molecular hydrogen, which suggest a complex interplay between the chemistry and physics of the circumstellar medium. Our findings shed light on the origin and evolution of RCB stars and their detectable characteristics, which may be useful for the interpretation of similar phenomena in other types of stars and environments.

We confirm that the source behaves as a persistent hard X-ray emitter between 2003 and 2012. We propose that XSS J12270-4859 hosts a neutron star in a propeller state, a state we investigate in detail, developing a theoretical model to reproduce the associated X-ray and gamma-ray properties. This model can be understood as being of a more general nature, representing a viable alternative by which LMXBs can appear as gamma-ray sources. In particular, this may apply to the case of millisecond pulsars performing a transition from a state powered by the rotation of their magnetic field, to a state powered by matter in-fall, such as that recently observed from the transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038. While the surface magnetic field of a typical NS in a LMXB is lower by more than four orders of magnitude than the much more intense fields of neutron stars accompanying high-mass binaries, the radius at which the matter in-flow is truncated in a NS-LMXB system is much lower. The magnetic field at the magnetospheric interface is then orders of magnitude larger at this interface, and as consequence, so is the power to accelerate electrons. We demonstrate that the cooling of the accelerated electron population takes place mainly through synchrotron interaction with the magnetic field permeating the interface, and through inverse Compton losses due to the interaction between the electrons and the synchrotron photons they emit. We found that self-synchrotron Compton processes can explain the high energy phenomenology of XSS J12270-4859. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this scenario, the material is prevented from falling onto the NS surface and instead is expelled from the system with a high velocity. This expelled material can then produce gamma-ray emission through a variety of mechanisms.\n",

The method is designed to allow image reconstruction for an extended number of transmitters and receivers in the presence noise and without plane wave approximation or otherwise approximation on the size or regularity of source and receiver functions. An overdetermined set of functions are formed from the Hadamard product between a Gaussian function and a uniformly distributed random number set. It is shown that this particular type of randomization tends to produce well-conditioned matrices whose pseudoinverses may be determined without implementing relaxation methods. When the inverted sets are applied to simulated first-order scattering from a Shepp-Logan phantom, successful image reconstructions are achieved for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as 1. Evaluation of the randomization approach is conducted by comparing condition numbers with other forms of signal randomization. Image quality resulting from tomographic reconstructions is then compared with an idealized synthetic aperture approach, which is subjected to a comparable SNR.

In this work a Lorentz violating extension of general relativity is studied where a nondynamical tensor couples to the Weyl tensor. A family of static and spherically symmetric solutions in vacuum is found, confirming that there are consistent solutions with explicit Lorentz violation in dynamical spacetimes. These solutions produce an unconventional dependence of the gravitational redshift, which, in turn, leads to the first bounds on such nondynamical tensor that do not rely on the physics of the early universe. Moreover, the bounds obtained in this work are competitive with respect to limits on similar nondynamical tensors. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 2629  The univariate extreme value theory deals with the convergence in type of powers of elements of sequences of cumulative distribution functions on the real line when the power index gets infinite. In terms of convergence of random variables, this amounts to the the weak convergence, in the sense of probability measures weak convergence, of the partial maximas of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. In this monograph, this theory is comprehensively studied in the broad frame of weak convergence of random vectors as exposed in Lo et al.(2016). It has two main parts.

We identify three ways of climbing the logical Clifford hierarchy from level $l$ to level $l+1$, each built on a recursive relation on the Pauli coefficients of the induced logical operators. Removal of $Z$-stabilizers may reduce distance, and the purpose of the third basic operation, addition of $X$-stabilizers, is to compensate for such losses. For the coherent noise model, we describe how to switch between computation and storage of intermediate results in a decoherence-free subspace by simply applying Pauli $X$ matrices. The approach to logical gate synthesis taken in prior work focuses on the code states, and results in sufficient conditions for a CSS code to be fixed by a transversal $Z$-rotation. In contrast, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions by analyzing the action of a transversal diagonal gate on the stabilizer group that determines the code.

However, the research in the heterogeneous multi-server scenario is limited, where the servers are located at small base-stations (SBSs), macro base-stations (MBSs), or the cloud with different computing and communication capabilities. On the other hand, computational-tasks offloading is limited by the type of MD-BS association with almost all previous works focusing on offloading the MD's computational tasks to the MEC servers/cloudlets at its serving BS. However, in multi-BS association, or downlink/uplink decoupled (DUDe) scenarios, an MD can be served by multiple BSs and hence has multiple offloading choices. Motivated by this, we proposed a joint BS association and subchannel allocation algorithm based on a student-project allocation (SPA) matching approach to minimize the network sum-latency, which break the constraint that one MD must connect to the same BS in the UL and DL, and jointly consider the communication and computational disparity of SBS and MBS cloudlets in heterogeneous MEC networks.

Here, we present a chemical abundance study of the outer halo (R$_{\\rm GC}$=18 kpc) GC NGC 1261, which has been suggested to be an accreted object. We measured 31 species of 29 elements in two stars from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra and find that the cluster is moderately metal poor, at [Fe/H]=-1.26. NGC 1261 is moderately $\\alpha$-enhanced to the 0.3-dex level. While from the small sample alone it is difficult to assert any abundance correlations, the light elements Na,O,Mg, and Al differ significantly between the two stars in contrast to the majority of other elements with smaller scatter; this argues in favour of multiple generations of stars coexisting in this GC. Intriguingly for its metallicity, NGC 1261 shows heavy element abundances that are consistent with $r$-process nucleosynthesis and we discuss their origin in various sites. In particular the Eu overabundance quantitatively suggests that one single $r$-process event, such as a neutron-star neutron-star merger or a rare kind of supernova, can be responsible for the stellar enhancement or even the enrichment of the cluster with the excess $r$-material. Its heavy element pattern makes NGC 1261 resemble the moderately enhanced r-I stars that are commonly found in the halo and have been detected in Gaia-Enceladus as well.

      "Inserting test sample 2653  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown their success as high-dimensional function approximators in many applications; however, training DNNs can be challenging in general. DNN training is commonly phrased as a stochastic optimization problem whose challenges include non-convexity, non-smoothness, insufficient regularization, and complicated data distributions. Hence, the performance of DNNs on a given task depends crucially on tuning hyperparameters, especially learning rates and regularization parameters. In the absence of theoretical guidelines or prior experience on similar tasks, this requires solving many training problems, which can be time-consuming and demanding on computational resources. This can limit the applicability of DNNs to problems with non-standard, complex, and scarce datasets, e.g., those arising in many scientific applications. To remedy the challenges of DNN training, we propose slimTrain, a stochastic optimization method for training DNNs with reduced sensitivity to the choice hyperparameters and fast initial convergence. The central idea of slimTrain is to exploit the separability inherent in many DNN architectures; that is, we separate the DNN into a nonlinear feature extractor followed by a linear model. This separability allows us to leverage recent advances made for solving large-scale, linear, ill-posed inverse problems. Crucially, for the linear weights, slimTrain does not require a learning rate and automatically adapts the regularization parameter. Since our method operates on mini-batches, its computational overhead per iteration is modest.

Second, every such layer is decomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the higher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the state space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis problems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional requirements on lower-level local games.\n",

      "Inserting test sample 2657  When a star comes too close to a supermassive black hole, it gets torn apart by strong tidal forces in a tidal disruption event, or TDE. Half of the elongated stream of debris comes back to the stellar pericenter where relativistic apsidal precession induces a self-crossing shock. As a result, the gas gets launched into an outflow that can experience additional interactions, leading to the formation of an accretion disc. We carry out the first radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of this process, making use of the same injection procedure to treat the self-crossing shock as in our previous adiabatic study (Bonnerot & Lu 2020). Two sets of realistic parameters of the problem are considered that correspond to different strengths of this initial interaction. In both cases, we find that the injected matter has its trajectories promptly circularized by secondary shocks taking place near the black hole. However, the generated internal energy efficiently diffuses away in the form of radiation, which results in a thin vertical profile of the formed disc. The diffusing photons promptly irradiate the surrounding debris until they emerge with a bolometric luminosity of $L\\approx 10^{44} \\, \\rm erg\\, s^{-1}$. Towards the self-crossing shock, diffusion is however slowed that results in a shallower luminosity increase, with a potentially significant component in the optical band. Matter launched to large distances continuously gains energy through radiation pressure, which can cause a significant fraction to become unbound.

These IMBHs can subsequently grow in the NSC and form an SMBH. We carry out $N$-body simulations of the simultaneous merger of three stellar clusters to form an NSC, and investigate the outcome of simulated runs containing zero, one, two and three IMBHs. We find that IMBHs can efficiently sink to the centre of the merged cluster. If multiple merging clusters contain an IMBH, we find that an IMBH binary is likely to form and subsequently merge by gravitational wave emission. We show that these mergers are catalyzed by dynamical interactions with surrounding stars, which systematically harden the binary and increase its orbital eccentricity. The seed SMBH will be ejected from the NSC by the recoil kick produced when two IMBHs merge, if their mass ratio $q\\gtrsim 0.15$. If the seed is ejected then no SMBH will form in the NSC.

      "Inserting test sample 2687  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between star formation and structure, using a mass-complete sample of 27,893 galaxies at $0.5<z<2.5$ selected from 3D-HST. We confirm that star-forming galaxies are larger than quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass (M$_{\\star}$). However, in contrast with some simulations, there is only a weak relation between star formation rate (SFR) and size within the star-forming population: when dividing into quartiles based on residual offsets in SFR, we find that the sizes of star-forming galaxies in the lowest quartile are 0.27$\\pm$0.06 dex smaller than the highest quartile. We show that 50% of star formation in galaxies at fixed M$_{\\star}$ takes place within a narrow range of sizes (0.26 dex). Taken together, these results suggest that there is an abrupt cessation of star formation after galaxies attain particular structural properties. Confirming earlier results, we find that central stellar density within a 1 kpc fixed physical radius is the key parameter connecting galaxy morphology and star formation histories: galaxies with high central densities are red and have increasingly lower SFR/M$_{\\star}$, whereas galaxies with low central densities are blue and have a roughly constant (higher) SFR/M$_{\\star}$ at a given redshift. We find remarkably little scatter in the average trends and a strong evolution of $>$0.5 dex in the central density threshold correlated with quiescence from $z\\sim0.7-2.0$.

Such automatic (aML) approaches show impressive success. Recent results even demonstrate intriguingly that deep learning applied for automatic classification of skin lesions is on par with the performance of dermatologists, yet outperforms the average. As human perception is inherently limited, such approaches can discover patterns, e.g. that two objects are similar, in arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces what no human is able to do. Humans can deal only with limited amounts of data, whilst big data is beneficial for aML; however, in health informatics, we are often confronted with a small number of data sets, where aML suffer of insufficient training samples and many problems are computationally hard. Here, interactive machine learning (iML) may be of help, where a human-in-the-loop contributes to reduce the complexity of NP-hard problems.

In this paper, we propose a high-level technique to estimate the nets with the rare activity of arithmetic modules from word-level information.

      "Inserting test sample 2708  In large N conformal field theories (CFTs), the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents have been shown to play a fundamental role in the behavior of the theories. These anomalous dimensions are related to the scaling dimensions of the operators and characterize the nonperturbative dynamics of the CFTs. In this paper, we investigate the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents in large N CFTs using the bootstrap approach. We present an analytic method to study the spectrum of anomalous dimensions for spin-l operators with l > 2, where previous methods have faced difficulties. We find that the anomalous dimensions exhibit nontrivial behavior, including a mixing of operators with different spins.

      "Inserting test sample 2711  A certain identification of points in a planar Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter (AdS) black hole generates a four-dimensional static black string. In turn, a rotating black string can be obtained from a static one by means of an `illegitimate coordinate transformation', a local boost in the compact direction. On the basis of the gauge/gravity duality, these black strings are dual to rotating thermal states of a strongly interacting conformal field theory (CFT) that lives on a cylinder. In this work, we obtain the complete quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the gravitational perturbations of rotating black strings. Analytic solutions for the dispersion relations are found in the hydrodynamic limit, characterized by fluctuations with wavenumber and frequency much smaller than the Hawking temperature of the string (or the temperature in the CFT dual description). We obtain these dispersion relations both by studying the gravitational perturbations of rotating black strings and by investigating the hydrodynamic fluctuations of a moving fluid living on the boundary of the AdS spacetime. Relativistic effects like the Doppler shift of the frequencies, wavelength contraction, and dilation of the thermalization time are shown explicitly in such a regime. We also investigate the behavior of a sound wave propagating in a viscous fluid for several values of the rotation parameter. The numerical solutions for the fundamental QNMs show a crossover (a transition) from a hydrodynamic-like behavior to a linear relativistic scaling for large wavenumbers. Additionally, we find a new family of QNMs which are purely damped in the zero wavenumber limit and that does not follow as a continuation of QNMs of the static black string, but that appears to be closely related to the algebraically special perturbation modes. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We evolve these isolated galaxy models using the GADGET-3 $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation code, paying particular attention to the effects of the gas halo on the evolution.

The model without a gas halo shows an increasing star formation rate (SFR) at the beginning of the simulation for some hundreds of millions of years and then a continuously decreasing rate to the end of the run at 3 Gyr. On the other hand, the SFRs in the models with a gas halo emerge to be either relatively flat throughout the simulations or increasing over a gigayear and then decreasing to the end. The models with the more centrally concentrated NFW gas halo show overall higher SFRs than those with the isothermal gas halo of the equal mass.\n",

The analysis reveals an overabundance of He, N, and Na, and a depletion of H, C, and O, on the surface of AG Car, indicating the presence of CNO-processed material. Furthermore, the ratio N/O is higher on the stellar surface than in the nebula. We found that the minimum phases of AG Car are not equal to each other, since we derived a noticeable difference between the maximum effective temperature achieved during 1985-1990 (22,800 K) and 2000-2001 (17,000 K). While the wind terminal velocity was 300 km/s in 1985-1990, it was as low as 105 km/s in 2001. The mass-loss rate, however, was lower from 1985-1990 (1.5 x 10^(-5) Msun/yr) than from 2000-2001 (3.7 x 10^(-5) Msun/yr). We found that the wind of AG Car is significantly clumped (f=0.10 - 0.25) and that clumps must be formed deep in the wind. We derived a bolometric luminosity of 1.5 x 10^6 Lsun during both minimum phases which, contrary to the common assumption, decreases to 1.0 x 10^6 Lsun as the star moves towards maximum flux in the V band. Assuming that the decrease in the bolometric luminosity of AG Car is due to the energy used to expand the outer layers of the star (Lamers 1995), we found that the expanding layers contain roughly 0.6 - 2 Msun.

      "Inserting test sample 2732  This paper presents a study of the luminous blue variable AG Carinae. Our analysis focuses on fundamental parameters during visual minimum phases and changes in bolometric luminosity during the S-Doradus cycle. We use a comprehensive dataset of multi-band photometry and spectroscopy to determine the effective temperature, luminosity, radius, and mass of the star during visual minimum phases. We find that AG Carinae displays significant variations in these parameters over the course of its S-Doradus cycle. Additionally, we analyze the star's spectral energy distribution and calculate the bolometric luminosity during different stages of the cycle. Our results show that AG Carinae experiences a significant increase in bolometric luminosity during the hotter and brighter phases of its cycle. We also investigate the spectral characteristics of the star and identify changes in both the strength and shape of spectral lines during the S-Doradus cycle. We discuss possible explanations for these observations, including mass loss, changes in opacity due to elemental abundance variations, and non-radial pulsations. We conclude that AG Carinae is a complex system that presents a rich variety of observational phenomena. Our study provides important insights into the physical processes driving the variability of this prototype luminous blue variable.

The insulating fermionic Ising spin glass model is shown to reveal different entangled magnetic instabilities and phase transitions. We review tricritical phenomena related to the strong correspondence between charge and spin fluctuations, being controlled by quantum statistics. We compare the spin density diluted Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass with classical spin 1 models such as the BEG model. We analyse in detail the infinite range model and show that spin glass order must decay discontinuously as the chemical potential exceeds a critical value, provided the temperature is below the tricritical one, and that the T=0 transition is of classical type. Parisi replica permutation symmetry breaking (RPSB) governs the thermal spin glass transitions and fermionic modifications of the SK-models AT-line emerge. RPSB takes place everywhere within the fermionic spin glass phase. Although the critical field theory of the quantum paramagnet to spin glass transition in metallic systems remains replica--symmetric at T=0, with only small corrections at low T from RPSB, the phase diagram is affected at O(T^0) by RPSB. Generalizing our results for the fermionic Ising spin glass we consider aspects of models with additional spin and charge quantum--dynamics such as metallic spin glasses. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March.

The enhanced production of ${D_s^+}$ relative to non-strange D mesons is also studied by comparing the $p_{ T}$-dependent ${D_s^+/D^0}$ production yield ratios in Pb-Pb and in pp collisions. The ratio measured in Pb-Pb collisions is found to be on average higher than that in pp collisions in the interval $2<p_{ T} <8$ GeV/$c$ with a significance of 2.3$\\sigma$ and 2.4$\\sigma$ for the 0-10% and 30-50% centrality intervals. The azimuthal anisotropy coefficient $v_2$ of prompt ${D_s^+}$ mesons was measured in Pb-Pb collisions in the 30-50% centrality interval and is found to be compatible with that of non-strange D mesons. The main features of the measured $R_{ AA}$, ${D_s^+/D^0}$ ratio, and $v_2$ as a function of $p_{ T}$ are described by theoretical calculations of charm-quark transport in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma including hadronisation via charm-quark recombination with light quarks from the medium.

      "Inserting test sample 2761  We present results on the variation of 7.7 micron Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in galaxies spanning a wide range in metallicity at z ~ 2. For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at 1.37 < z < 2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer metallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron and Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron luminosities (L(7.7)) and total IR luminosities (L(IR)), respectively. We find significant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected SFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O32) emission-line ratio. The latter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends indicate a paucity of PAH emission in low metallicity environments with harder and more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly lower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to older galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB stars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of ~ 2 for galaxies with masses $M_* < 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, compared to the more massive ones. We demonstrate that commonly-used conversions of L(7.7) (or 24 micron flux density; f(24)) to L(IR) underestimate the IR luminosity by more than a factor of 2 at $M_*$ ~ $10^{9.6-10.0} M_{\\odot}$.

It changes the generation and propagation process of the plasma, forming a plasma plume contributes to the propulsion performance of the thruster. Through theoretical analysis of the obtained plume data, it is indicated that the ablative pulsed plasma thruster based on multi-anode electrode geometry (short for multi-anode APPT) promotes the internal pressure of the plasma jet during its propagation and significantly increases the density and energy of charged particles. The discharge phenomena manifest that the multi-anode APPT and the helix-coil multi-anode APPT effectively increase the intensity of the plasma plume. Through electron density spatial distribution measurement, it has been found that the helix-coil multi-anode APPT increases the density of plasma in the axial direction to more than 4 times of the conventional coaxial APPT and reduces the electron density in other directions. In the propulsion test, it has been demonstrated that the multi-anode APPT and the helix-coil multi-anode APPT have better performance in terms of the impulse bit and the thrust-to-power ratio. In addition, it is also identified that the pinch effect will be enhanced with the increase of discharge power and the propulsion performance is promoted more distinctly.

In particular, we suggest using the optimization targets of flow-based generative models, a class of models that can capture complex distributions by transforming a simple base distribution through layers of nonlinearities. We call these flow-based likelihoods (FBL). We analyze the accuracy and precision of the reconstructed likelihoods on mock Gaussian data, and show that simply gauging the quality of samples drawn from the trained model is not a sufficient indicator that the true likelihood has been learned.\n",

This suggests that works that have found small posterior shifts in NG data with data-driven likelihoods such as these could be underestimating the impact of non-Gaussianity in parameter constraints. By introducing a suite of tests that can capture different levels of NG in the data, we show that the success or failure of traditional data-driven likelihoods can be tied back to the structure of the NG in the data.

These maximizing paths and their energies may be viewed via a coordinate system that respects these scalings. What emerges by doing so is a system indexed by $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $s,t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $s < t$ of unit order quantities $W_n\\big( x,s ; y,t \\big)$ specifying the scaled energy of the maximizing path that moves in scaled coordinates between $(x,s)$ and $(y,t)$. The space-time Airy sheet is, after a parabolic adjustment, the putative distributional limit $W_\\infty$ of this system as $n \\to \\infty$. The Airy sheet has recently been constructed in [15] as such a limit of Brownian last passage percolation. In this article, we initiate the study of fractal geometry in the Airy sheet.

Points of violation correspond to special behaviour for scaled maximizing paths, and we prove the result by investigating this behaviour, making use of two inputs from recent studies of scaled Brownian LPP; namely, Brownian regularity of profiles, and estimates on the rarity of pairs of disjoint scaled maximizing paths that begin and end close to each other. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt emission have long been theorized to be able to answer most of these questions. The POLAR detector was a dedicated GRB polarimeter developed by a Swiss, Chinese and Polish collaboration. The instrument was launched, together with the second Chinese Space Lab, the Tiangong-2, in September 2016 after which it took 6 months of scientific data. During this period POLAR detected 55 GRBs as well as several pulsars. From the analysis of the GRB polarization catalog we see that the prompt emission is lowly polarized or fully unpolarized. There is, however, the caveat that within single pulses there are strong hints of an evolving polarization angle which washes out the polarization degree in the time integrated analysis. Building on the success of the POLAR mission, the POLAR-2 instrument is currently under development.

They represent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are detectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on the equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the frequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total binary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the radii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the dominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high accuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and asymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the binary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We summarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of the postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant can be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be described by concepts of asteroseismology. The understanding of the different mechanisms shaping the gravitational-wave signal yields a physically motivated analytic model of the gravitational-wave emission, which may form the basis for template-based gravitational-wave data analysis.

      "Inserting test sample 2801  We theoretically consider the substrate-induced Majorana localization length renormalization in nanowires in contact with a bulk superconductor in the strong tunnel-coupled regime, showing explicitly that this renormalization depends strongly on the transverse size of the one-dimensional nanowires. For metallic (e.g. Fe on Pb) or semiconducting (e.g. InSb on Nb) nanowires, the renormalization effect is found to be very strong and weak respectively because the transverse confinement size in the two situations happens to be 0.5nm (metallic nanowire) and 20nm (semiconducting nanowire). Thus, the Majorana localization length could be very short (long) for metallic (semiconducting) nanowires even for the same values of all other parameters (except for the transverse wire size). We also show that any tunneling conductance measurements in such nanowires, carried out at temperatures and/or energy resolutions comparable to the induced superconducting energy gap, cannot distinguish between the existence of the Majorana modes or ordinary subgap fermionic states since both produce very similar broad and weak peaks in the subgap tunneling conductance independent of the localization length involved. Only low temperature (and high resolution) tunneling measurements manifesting sharp zero bias peaks can be considered to be signatures of Majorana modes in topological nanowires. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

To study this effect, we employ a self-consistent numerical method which takes into account the parameters of the substrate, such as its dielectric constant and material properties.

      "Inserting test sample 2807  This paper investigates ARQ (Automatic Repeat request) designs for PNC (Physical-layer Network Coding) systems. We have previously found that, besides TWRC (Two-Way Relay Channel) operated on the principle of PNC, there are many other PNC building blocks--building blocks are simple small network structures that can be used to construct a large network. In some of these PNC building blocks, receivers can obtain side information through overhearing. Although such overheard information is not the target information that the receivers desire, the receivers can exploit the overheard information together with a network-coded packet received to obtain a desired native packet. This leads to throughput gain. Our previous study, however, assumed what is sent always get received. In practice, that is not the case. Error control is needed to ensure reliable communication. This paper focuses on the use of ARQ to ensure reliable PNC communication. The availability of overheard Information and its potential exploitation make the ARQ design of a network-coded system different from that of a non-network-coded system. In this paper, we lay out the fundamental considerations for such ARQ design: 1) We address how to track the stored coded packets and overheard packets to increase the chance of packet extraction, and derive the throughput gain achieved by tracking 2) We investigate two variations of PNC ARQ, coupled and non-coupled ARQs, and prove that non-coupled ARQ is more efficient; 3) We show how to optimize parameters in PNC ARQ--specifically the window size and ACK frequency--to minimize the throughput degradation caused by ACK feedback overhead and wasteful retransmissions due to lost ACK. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Based on techniques from noncommutative algebra (semiprime PI algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension one), we construct a framework for the systematic study of the structure of the algebra $\\mathcal D(W)$ of matrix differential operators for which the orthogonal polynomials of the weight matrix $W(x)$ are eigenfunctions. The ingredients for this algebraic setting are derived from the analytic properties of the orthogonal matrix polynomials.

In the case of $2\\times 2$ weights, it is proved that fullness is satisfied as long as $\\mathcal D(W)$ is noncommutative.

We perform numerical simulations of a turbulent, shearing flow to investigate the growth dynamics of small-scale dynamo at different Pm values. Our results show an increase in the critical magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) for decreasing Pm. The critical Rm marks the transition from an initial kinematic phase where the magnetic field grows exponentially, to a saturated phase where the magnetic field is limited by nonlinear effects.

Additionally, the 4f-3d interaction coupling has a significant effect on the magnetic properties. The anisotropy of each 4f-ion modifies the magnetic properties of its 3d neighbor, leading to non-trivial magnetism that is unique to this new class of 3d-4f molecular materials. Furthermore, these molecular compounds exhibit a complex thermal behavior. High-temperature peaks in the magnetic susceptibility data coincide with features in heat capacity data, a trend not observed in previous ladder-type compounds. These results demonstrate a promising new direction for future study of molecular-based magnetic materials. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2833  TV white spaces refer to the allocated but locally unused TV spectrum and can be used by unlicensed devices as secondary users. Thanks to their lower frequencies (e.g., 54 -- 698 MHz in the US), communication over the TV spectrum has excellent propagation characteristics over long distances and through obstacles. These characteristics along with their wide availability make the TV white spaces a great choice and alternative to many existing wireless technologies, especially the ones that need long range and high bandwidth communication. In the last decade, there have been numerous efforts from academia, industries, and standards bodies for exploiting the potentials of the TV white spaces for several applications including wireless broadband Internet access. Their characteristics and features also hold potentials for many new applications including sensing and monitoring, Internet of Things, wireless control, smart utility, location-based services, and transportation and logistics. In this paper, we perform a retrospective review and comparative study of existing work on networking in the TV white spaces. Additionally, we discuss the associated research challenges such as dealing with the interference between primary and secondary TV spectrum users, TV white space temporal and spatial variations and fragmentation, antenna design, mobility, and security. We also describe the future research directions to handle the above challenges.

However, network congestion is a growing concern and has resulted in the spectrum becoming a scarce resource. With the increasingly popular use of TV white spaces (TVWS) over the past decade, they have been identified as a potential solution for spectrum scarcity. This paper presents a survey of the key developments in networking over TVWS, as well as a comprehensive analysis of the available literature in this area. The paper reviews the technologies utilized in networking over TVWS, the regulatory and standardization aspects of TVWS, and the challenges posed by the unique propagation characteristics of TVWS. In addition, the study highlights the key applications of TVWS networking such as rural connectivity, smart grid, and emergency communication. Furthermore, the paper presents a detailed comparison of the performance of TVWS networking and traditional wireless networking. The results show that TVWS networking has a significant potential to offer cost-effective and long-range wireless connectivity, especially for rural areas. Although there are challenges to the adoption of TVWS networking, the study concludes that networking over TVWS is a promising research area that can enhance the available spectrum for wireless communication. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2835  Future observations of CMB anisotropies will be able to probe high multipole regions of the angular power spectrum, corresponding to a resolution of a few arcminutes. Dust emission from merging haloes is one of the foregrounds that will affect such very small scales. We estimate the contribution to CMB angular fluctuations from objects that are bright in the sub-millimeter band due to intense star formation bursts following merging episodes. We base our approach on the Lacey-Cole merger model and on the Kennicutt relation which connects the star formation rate in galaxies with their infrared luminosity. We set the free parameters of the model in order to not exceed the SCUBA source counts, the Madau plot of star formation rate in the universe and COBE/FIRAS data on the intensity of the sub-millimeter cosmic background radiation. We show that the angular power spectrum arising from the distribution of such star-forming haloes will be one of the most significant foregrounds in the high frequency channels of future CMB experiments, such as PLANCK, ACT and SPT. The correlation term, due to the clustering of multiple haloes at redshift z~2-6, is dominant in the broad range of angular scales 200<l<3000. Poisson fluctuations due to bright sub-millimeter sources are more important at higher l, but since they are generated from the bright sources, such contribution could be strongly reduced if bright sources are excised from the sky maps. The contribution of the correlation term to the angular power spectrum depends strongly on the redshift evolution of the escape fraction of UV photons and the resulting temperature of the dust. The measurement of this signal will therefore give important information about galaxies in the early stage of their evolution. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

      "Inserting test sample 2837  We conduct a comprehensive theoretical and numerical investigation of the pollution of pristine gas in turbulent flows, designed to provide new tools for modeling the evolution of the first generation of stars. The properties of such Population III (Pop III) stars are thought to be very different than later generations, because cooling is dramatically different in gas with a metallicity below a critical value Z_c, which lies between ~10^-6 and 10^-3 solar value. Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and thus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays a crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The small critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the PDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of gas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows that the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized self-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where n is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con is determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants. Using a suite of simulations with Mach numbers ranging from M = 0.9 to 6.2, we provide accurate fits to n and tau_con as a function of M, Z_c/<Z>, and the scale, L_p, at which pollutants are added to the flow. For P>0.9, mixing occurs only in the regions surrounding the pollutants, such that n=1. For smaller P, n is larger as mixing becomes more global. We show how the results can be used to construct one-zone models for the evolution of Pop III stars in a single high-redshift galaxy, as well as subgrid models for tracking the evolution of the first stars in large cosmological simulations. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Measuring precise masses is the most challenging part, especially in multi-planetary systems. We measure the masses and densities of a four-planet near resonant chain system (K2-32), and a young ($\\sim400$ Myr old) planetary system consisting of three close-in small planets (K2-233). We obtained 199 new HARPS observations for K2-32 and 124 for K2-233 covering a more than three year baseline. We find that K2-32 is a compact scaled-down version of the Solar System's architecture, with a small rocky inner planet (M$_e=2.1^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$~M$_{\\oplus}$, P$_e\\sim4.35$~days) followed by an inflated Neptune-mass planet (M$_b=15.0^{+1.8}_{-1.7}$~M$_{\\oplus}$, P$_b\\sim8.99$~days) and two external sub-Neptunes (M$_c=8.1\\pm2.4$~M$_{\\oplus}$, P$_c\\sim20.66$~days; M$_d=6.7\\pm2.5$~M$_{\\oplus}$, P$_d\\sim31.72$~days).

      "Inserting test sample 2845  Over the last decade, digital media (web or app publishers) generalized the use of real time ad auctions to sell their ad spaces. Multiple auction platforms, also called Supply-Side Platforms (SSP), were created. Because of this multiplicity, publishers started to create competition between SSPs. In this setting, there are two successive auctions: a second price auction in each SSP and a secondary, first price auction, called header bidding auction, between SSPs.In this paper, we consider an SSP competing with other SSPs for ad spaces. The SSP acts as an intermediary between an advertiser wanting to buy ad spaces and a web publisher wanting to sell its ad spaces, and needs to define a bidding strategy to be able to deliver to the advertisers as many ads as possible while spending as little as possible. The revenue optimization of this SSP can be written as a contextual bandit problem, where the context consists of the information available about the ad opportunity, such as properties of the internet user or of the ad placement.Using classical multi-armed bandit strategies (such as the original versions of UCB and EXP3) is inefficient in this setting and yields a low convergence speed, as the arms are very correlated. In this paper we design and experiment a version of the Thompson Sampling algorithm that easily takes this correlation into account. We combine this bayesian algorithm with a particle filter, which permits to handle non-stationarity by sequentially estimating the distribution of the highest bid to beat in order to win an auction. We apply this methodology on two real auction datasets, and show that it significantly outperforms more classical approaches.The strategy defined in this paper is being developed to be deployed on thousands of publishers worldwide. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

In this study, we propose the use of the Thompson Sampling technique to address the SSP header bidding strategy optimization problem. This Bayesian algorithm enables the selection of the most profitable DSPs within a mutually exclusive consideration set, bypassing the weakness of the existing less-efficient heuristic methods and fully exploring the underlying distribution of the problem. We conducted a real-world experiment, applying the Thompson Sampling technique to a data set of 8 million bid requests obtained from the OpenX ad exchange. The results show that when compared with the widely used heuristic techniques, such as maximum revenue and secondary price auctions, the proposed method significantly outperforms them in terms of gross revenue. The proposed technique outperforms the benchmark methods by 220% and 83%, respectively. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the models' performance by discussing their impact on different metrics, and analyzing scenarios when the proposed technique may not yield the best results.

      "Inserting test sample 2859  Supervised dimensionality reduction has emerged as an important theme in the last decade. Despite the plethora of models and formulations, there is a lack of a simple model which aims to project the set of patterns into a space defined by the classes (or categories). To this end, we set up a model in which each class is represented as a 1D subspace of the vector space formed by the features. Assuming the set of classes does not exceed the cardinality of the features, the model results in multi-class supervised learning in which the features of each class are projected into the class subspace. Class discrimination is automatically guaranteed via the imposition of orthogonality of the 1D class sub-spaces. The resulting optimization problem - formulated as the minimization of a sum of quadratic functions on a Stiefel manifold - while being non-convex (due to the constraints), nevertheless has a structure for which we can identify when we have reached a global minimum. After formulating a version with standard inner products, we extend the formulation to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in a straightforward manner. The optimization approach also extends in a similar fashion to the kernel version. Results and comparisons with the multi-class Fisher linear (and kernel) discriminants and principal component analysis (linear and kernel) showcase the relative merits of this approach to dimensionality reduction. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

Our approach is based on the idea that the categories of a dataset contain valuable information that can be leveraged to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Specifically, we introduce a framework that constructs a category space from the original feature space and then learns a low-dimensional projection of the category space via a supervised learning algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of classification accuracy, running time, and scalability. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to noisy and incomplete data, making it suitable for real-world applications. To provide insights into the working mechanisms of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments and provide detailed analysis of the learned category space. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our approach in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.

The turbulent component of the velocity dispersion of NH$_3$(1,1) is found to be positively correlated with the gas kinetic temperature, which indicates that the dense gas may be heated by dissipation of turbulent energy.

We analyse a set of simulations run with the code described by Scannapieco et al. (2005, 2006), where we have tested our star formation and feedback prescription using isolated galaxy models. Here we extend this work by simulating the formation of a galaxy in its proper cosmological framework, focusing on the ability of the model to form a disk-like structure in rotational support. We find that SN feedback plays a fundamental role in the evolution of the simulated galaxy, efficiently regulating the star formation activity, pressurizing the gas and generating mass-loaded galactic winds. These processes affect several galactic properties such as final stellar mass, morphology, angular momentum, chemical properties, and final gas and baryon fractions. In particular, we find that our model is able to reproduce extended disk components with high specific angular momentum and a significant fraction of young stars. The galaxies are also found to have significant spheroids composed almost entirely of stars formed at early times. We find that most combinations of the input parameters yield disk-like components, although with different sizes and thicknesses, indicating that the code can form disks without fine-tuning the implemented physics. We also show how our model scales to smaller systems.

The effects of supernova feedback on the formation of galaxy disks have been explored through numerous theoretical and observational studies. In this study, we investigate the impact of supernova feedback on the gas and stellar properties of disk galaxies using a series of hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations reveal that supernova explosions, by injecting energy and momentum into the interstellar medium, can drive large-scale outflows of gas, which in turn affect the mass, velocity structure, and chemical enrichment of the disk. Moreover, supernova feedback is found to regulate the star formation rate by heating and dispersing the gas necessary for star formation. Our analysis also shows that the efficiency of supernova feedback depends on various factors, such as the star formation rate, gas fraction, and stellar surface density. By comparing our simulations with observational data of nearby disk galaxies, we find that our model predictions are in good agreement with the observed correlations between the supernova rate, gas content, and star formation activity of galaxies.

The near- infrared photometry (JK filters) was obtained by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) public survey \"VISTA near-infrared Y; J;Ks survey of the Magellanic Clouds system\"(VMC). For each pulsator isoperiodic model sequences have been computed by adopting a nonlinear convective hydrodynamical code in order to reproduce the multi- filter light and (when available) radial velocity curve amplitudes and morphological details. The inferred individual distances provide an intrinsic mean value for the SMC distance modulus of 19.01 mag and a standard deviation of 0.08 mag, in agreement with the literature. Moreover the instrinsic masses and luminosities of the best fitting model show that all these pulsators are brighter than the canonical evolutionary Mass- Luminosity relation (MLR), suggesting a significant efficiency of core overshooting and/or mass loss. Assuming that the inferred deviation from the canonical MLR is only due to mass loss, we derive the expected distribution of percentage mass loss as a function of both the pulsation period and of the canonical stellar mass. Finally, a good agreement is found between the predicted mean radii and current Period-Radius (PR) relations in the SMC available in the literature.

      "Inserting test sample 2915  For many machine learning tasks, the input data lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional space and, because of this high-dimensional structure, most algorithms are inefficient. The typical solution is to reduce the dimension of the input data using standard dimension reduction algorithms such as ISOMAP, LAPLACIAN EIGENMAPS or LLES. This approach, however, does not always work in practice as these algorithms require that we have somewhat ideal data. Unfortunately, most data sets either have missing entries or unacceptably noisy values. That is, real data are far from ideal and we cannot use these algorithms directly. In this paper, we focus on the case when we have missing data. Some techniques, such as matrix completion, can be used to fill in missing data but these methods do not capture the non-linear structure of the manifold. Here, we present a new algorithm MR-MISSING that extends these previous algorithms and can be used to compute low dimensional representation on data sets with missing entries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by running three different experiments. We visually verify the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic manifolds, we numerically compare our projections against those computed by first filling in data using nlPCA and mDRUR on the MNIST data set, and we also show that we can do classification on MNIST with missing data.

Our method takes advantage of the pairwise relationships between objects to learn a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding, which preserves the original distance structure as much as possible. We formulate our approach in a probabilistic framework and derive an efficient algorithm for optimization. Our experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to missing data. Moreover, our method can handle both the missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) scenarios, which are common in many real-world applications. We also investigate the impact of missing data on the learned metric and show that our method can effectively handle moderate to high levels of missingness.

      "Inserting test sample 2927  Based on the SED, Herbig stars have been categorized into two observational groups, reflecting their overall disk structure: group I members have disks with a higher degree of flaring than their group II counterparts. We investigate the 5-35 um Spitzer IRS spectra of a sample of 13 group I sources and 20 group II sources. We focus on the continuum emission to study the underlying disk geometry. We have determined the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7] continuum flux ratios. The 7-um flux excess with respect to the stellar photosphere is measured, as a marker for the strength of the near-IR emission produced by the inner disk. We have compared our data to self-consistent passive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We confirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between group I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small dust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and [13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources. Moreover, the [30/13.5] flux ratio decreases with increasing 7-um excess for all targets in the sample. To explain these correlations with the models, we need to introduce an artificial scaling factor for the inner disk height. In roughly 50% of the Herbig Ae/Be stars in our sample, the inner disk must be inflated by a factor 2 to 3 beyond what hydrostatic calculations predict. The total disk mass in small dust grains determines the degree of flaring. We conclude, however, that for any given disk mass in small dust grains, the shadowing of the outer (tens of AU) disk is determined by the scale height of the inner disk (1 AU).

      "Inserting test sample 2941  We analyzed 123 thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer from the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-536. All but two of the 40 radius-exansion bursts in this sample reached peak fluxes which were normally distributed about a mean of 6.4e-8 ergs/cm^2/s, with a standard deviation of 7.6%. The remaining two radius-expansion bursts reached peak fluxes a factor of 1.69+/-0.13 lower than this mean value; as a consequence, the overall variation in the peak flux of the radius-expansion bursts was a factor of ~2. This variation is comparable to the range of the Eddington limit between material with solar H-fraction (X=0.7) and pure He. Such a variation may arise if, for the bright radius-expansion bursts, most of the accreted H is eliminated either by steady hot CNO burning or expelled in a radiatively-driven wind. However, steady burning cannot exhaust the accreted H for solar composition material within the typical ~2 hr burst recurrence time, nor can it result in sufficient elemental stratification to allow selective ejection of the H only. An additional stratification mechanism appears to be required to separate the accreted elements and thus allow preferential ejection of the hydrogen. We found no evidence for a gap in the peak flux distribution between the radius-expansion and non-radius expansion bursts, previously observed in smaller samples. Assuming that the faint radius-expansion bursts reached the Eddington limit for H-rich material (X~0.7), and the brighter bursts the limit for pure He (X=0), we estimate the distance to 4U 1636-536 (for a canonical neutron star with M_NS=1.4M_sun, R_NS=10 km) to be 6.0+/-0.5 kpc, or for M_NS=2M_sun at most 7.1 kpc.

      "Inserting test sample 2942  This paper investigates the possibility of using Eddington-limited X-ray bursts as distance indicators. We focus specifically on the potential compositional effects present in bursts from the source 4U 1636-536. We analyzed multiple bursts from this source using data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Our analysis suggests that a compositional difference exists between the bursts, as evidenced by the varying rise times and cooling trends. We also find that the burst fluence and spectral shape do not correlate with the burst rise time, indicating that these two properties are not solely dependent on composition. Our results suggest that bursts from sources with different compositions may show different properties, which would lead to potentially inaccurate distance estimates. Furthermore, our findings support the hypothesis that accreted matter is the primary driver of burst behavior, with secondary effects from composition. We also investigate the possibility of using the cooling tail of the bursts to infer neutron star radii, but find that our data is insufficient to make firm conclusions. Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering compositional effects in interpreting burst data, particularly for sources with different compositions.

      "Inserting test sample 2943  We propose a novel point cloud based 3D organ segmentation pipeline utilizing deep Q-learning. In order to preserve shape properties, the learning process is guided using a statistical shape model. The trained agent directly predicts piece-wise linear transformations for all vertices in each iteration. This mapping between the ideal transformation for an object outline estimation is learned based on image features. To this end, we introduce aperture features that extract gray values by sampling the 3D volume within the cone centered around the associated vertex and its normal vector. Our approach is also capable of estimating a hierarchical pyramid of non rigid deformations for multi-resolution meshes. In the application phase, we use a marginal approach to gradually estimate affine as well as non-rigid transformations. We performed extensive evaluations to highlight the robust performance of our approach on a variety of challenge data as well as clinical data. Additionally, our method has a run time ranging from 0.3 to 2.7 seconds to segment each organ. In addition, we show that the proposed method can be applied to different organs, X-ray based modalities, and scanning protocols without the need of transfer learning. As we learn actions, even unseen reference meshes can be processed as demonstrated in an example with the Visible Human.

This paper presents a new electrocardiogram (ECG) independent approach for estimating heart rate (HR) during low and high lung volume (LLV and HLV, respectively) phases using SCG signals. In this study, SCG, ECG, and respiratory flow rate (RFR) signals were measured simultaneously in 7 healthy subjects. The lung volume information was calculated from the RFR and was used to group the SCG events into low and high lung-volume groups. LLV and HLV SCG events were then used to estimate the subjects HR as well as the HR during LLV and HLV in 3 different postural positions, namely supine, 45 degree heads-up, and sitting. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested against the standard ECG measurements. Results showed that the HR estimations from the SCG and ECG signals were in a good agreement (bias of 0.08 bpm). All subjects were found to have a higher HR during HLV (HR$_\\text{HLV}$) compared to LLV (HR$_\\text{LLV}$) at all postural positions.

The reason for this is given by the fact that such content is often prohibited in certain environments (e.g., schools and workplaces) or for certain publics (e.g., children). In recent years, many works have been mainly focused on detecting pornographic images and videos based on visual content, particularly on the detection of skin color. Although these approaches provide good results, they generally have the disadvantage of a high false positive rate since not all images with large areas of skin exposure are necessarily pornographic images, such as people wearing swimsuits or images related to sports. Local feature based approaches with Bag-of-Words models (BoW) have been successfully applied to visual recognition tasks in the context of pornography detection. Even though existing methods provide promising results, they use local feature descriptors that require a high computational processing time yielding high-dimensional vectors. In this work, we propose an approach for pornography detection based on local binary feature extraction and BossaNova image representation, a BoW model extension that preserves more richly the visual information. Moreover, we propose two approaches for video description based on the combination of mid-level representations namely BossaNova Video Descriptor (BNVD) and BoW Video Descriptor (BoW-VD).

We observe a significant signal in the region of interest and measure the branching fraction to be (6.5±1.5(stat)±0.9(syst))×10−6, corresponding to a partial width of (30±7(stat)±4(syst)) eV. This is the first observation of the E1 transition in X(3872) and provides new information on its electromagnetic properties. We compare our results with theoretical calculations and discuss the implications for the nature of X(3872). Our measurements constrain the range of possible interpretations and provide valuable input to models aimed at understanding this enigmatic particle. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2965  Message passing neural networks (MPNN) have provable limitations, which can be overcome by universal networks. However, universal networks are typically impractical. The only exception is random node initialization (RNI), a data augmentation method that results in provably universal networks. Unfortunately, RNI suffers from severe drawbacks such as slow convergence and high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameters. We transfer powerful techniques from the practical world of graph isomorphism testing to MPNNs, resolving these drawbacks. This culminates in individualization-refinement node initialization (IRNI). We replace the indiscriminate and haphazard randomness used in RNI by a surgical incision of only a few random bits at well-selected nodes. Our novel non-intrusive data-augmentation scheme maintains the networks' universality while resolving the trainability issues. We formally prove the claimed universality and corroborate experimentally -- on synthetic benchmarks sets previously explicitly designed for that purpose -- that IRNI overcomes the limitations of MPNNs.

This model accounts for the automatic response of the grid to load fluctuations that take place on the scale of minutes, when the optimum power flow adjustments and load shedding controls are unavailable. We describe extreme events, initiated by load fluctuations, which cause cascading failures of loads, generators and lines. Our model is quasi-static in the causal, discrete time and sequential resolution of individual failures. The model, in its simplest realization based on the Directed Current description of the power flow problem, is tested on three standard IEEE systems consisting of 30, 39 and 118 buses. Our statistical analysis suggests a straightforward classification of cascading and islanding phases in terms of the ratios between average number of removed loads, generators and links.

The IAPP scheme determines the optimal positioning of the UAVs by considering both the RF interference caused by the transmission over the same frequency and the multi-path propagation of wireless signals. The UAVs' positions are optimized such that the overall network capacity is maximized while the interference between the links is minimized. The proposed scheme employs a hybrid approach combining the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the gradient descent method, which has been shown to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation for the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IAPP scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of network capacity, bit error rate and energy efficiency.

These lenses have half-light radii r_e=2.6-8 kpc and stellar masses of log M*/Ms=10.9-11.4, and therefore resemble nearby passive elliptical galaxies. The lensed QSO sightlines presented here occur at projected distances of d=3-15 kpc (or d~1-2 r_e) from the lensing galaxies, providing for the first time an opportunity to probe both interstellar gas at r~r_e and circumgalactic gas at larger radii r>>re of these distant quiescent galaxies. We observe distinct gas absorption properties among different lenses and among sightlines of individual lenses. Specifically, while the quadruple lens for HE0435-1223 shows no absorption features to very sensitive limits along all four sightlines, strong Mg II, Fe II, Mg I, and Ca II absorption transitions are detected along both sightlines near the double lens for HE0047-1756, and in one of the two sightlines near the double lens for HE1104-1805. The absorbers are resolved into 8-15 individual components with a line-of-sight velocity spread of dv~300-600 km/s. The large ionic column densities, log N>14, observed in two components suggest that these may be Lyman limit or damped Lya absorbers with a significant neutral hydrogen fraction. The majority of the absorbing components exhibit a uniform super solar Fe/Mg ratio with a scatter of <0.1 dex across the full dv range. Given a predominantly old stellar population in these lensing galaxies, we argue that the observed large velocity width and Fe-rich abundance pattern can be explained by SNe Ia enriched gas at radius r~r_e.

We have selected a sample of 39 massive galaxy clusters from the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample, and used Northern VLA Sky Survey data to analyze the fractional polarization of radio sources out to 10 core radii from the cluster centers. Following Murgia et al (2004), we have investigated how different magnetic field strengths affect the observed polarized emission of sources lying at different projected distances from the cluster center. In addition, statistical tests are performed to investigate the fractional polarization trends in clusters with different thermal and non-thermal properties. We find a trend of the fractional polarization with the cluster impact parameter, with fractional polarization increasing at the cluster periphery and decreasing toward the cluster center. Such trend can be reproduced by a magnetic field model with central value of few $\\mu$G. The logrank statistical test indicates that there are no differences in the depolarization trend observed in cluster with and without radio halo, while the same test indicates significant differences when the depolarization trend of sources in clusters with and without cool core are compared. The comparison between clusters with high and low temperatures does not yields significant differences.

Synchrotron diffraction measurements of EuFeO3 films under strain states ranging from 2% compressive to 0.9% tensile on cubic or rhombohedral substrates exhibit a combination of a-a+c- and a+a-c- rotational patterns. We compare the EuFeO3 behavior with previously reported experimental and theoretical work on strained Pbnm-type films on non-orthorhombic substrates, as well as additional measurements from LaGaO3, LaFeO3, and Eu0.7Sr0.3MnO3 films on SrTiO3. Compiling the results from various material systems reveals a general strain dependence in which compressive strain strongly favors a-a+c- and a+a-c- rotation patterns and tensile strain weakly favors a-a-c+ structures. In contrast, EuFeO3 films grown on Pbnm-type GdScO3 under 2.3% tensile strain take on a uniform a-a+c- rotation pattern imprinted from the substrate, despite strain energy considerations that favor the a-a-c+ pattern.

In this study, replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations were performed on a pair of homologous proteins with diverse sequences but a common fold. The results showed that the folding of both proteins experienced similar energetic barriers, localizing mainly at specific positions within the primary sequence. These positions corresponded to the β-turns at the C-terminal end of strands, the sequence of which determines the folding properties of β-sandwich proteins.

      "Inserting test sample 2981  The AMPS paradox challenges black hole complementarity by apparently constructing a way for an observer to bring information from the outside of the black hole into its interior if there is no drama at its horizon, making manifest a violation of monogamy of entanglement. We propose a new resolution to the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling observer in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the horizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition (we call it \"little drama\") which is the \"complementarity dual\" of scrambling of information on the stretched horizon. When translated to the description of the black hole interior, this implies that the fine-grained quantum information of infalling matter is rapidly diffused across the entire interior while classical observables and coarse-grained geometry remain unaffected. Under the assumption that information has diffused throughout the interior, we consider the difficulty of the information-theoretic task that an observer must perform after crossing the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole in order to verify a violation of monogamy of entanglement. We find that the time required to complete a necessary subroutine of this task, namely the decoding of Bell pairs from the interior and the late radiation, takes longer than the maximum amount of time that an observer can spend inside the black hole before hitting the singularity. Therefore, an infalling observer cannot observe monogamy violation before encountering the singularity. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",

We demonstrate that mirror figure errors cause a dependence of transverse mode offset frequency on spot position. Combined with low frequency residual motion of suspended mirrors, this leads to transverse mode frequency modulation which suppresses the effective parametric gain. We show that this gain suppression mechanism can be enhanced by laser spot dithering or fast thermal modulation.

Our analysis reveals interesting results regarding the thermodynamic stability of the black hole, which we investigate in detail. Additionally, we examine the thermodynamic phase transitions that can occur in this system, and discuss the corresponding phase diagrams. We conclude by highlighting the implications of our study for the understanding of black hole thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter space. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2993  We report a measurement of the B^0_s meson lifetime from B_s^0 -> D^-_s X decays, where D_s^- mesons are reconstructed in the D_s^- -> phi pi^- and D_s^- -> K^{*0} K^- decay channels. From approximately 3.7 million hadronic Z^0 decays recorded by the OPAL detector at LEP a sample is selected containing 911 +/- 83 candidates, of which 519 +/- 136 are estimated to be from B_s^0 meson decays. Fitting the distribution of the distance from the beam spot to the decay vertex of the D_s^- candidates with an unbinned likelihood function we measure tau(B_s^0) = 1.72 + 0.20 - 0.19 + 0.18 - 0.17 ps, where the errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2994  In this study, we present a measurement of the lifetime of the B_s^0 meson using the decay chain B_s^0 -> D_s^- pi^+. The decay products are reconstructed in a sample of proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected using the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurement is based on the analysis of the decay-time distribution of the reconstructed D_s^- mesons. Our result, tau(B_s^0) = 1.504 ± 0.040(stat) ± 0.021(syst) ps, is consistent with previous measurements and with the world average value. This measurement is important for testing the predictions of the Standard Model and for future searches for new physics in the B_s^0 sector. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2995  We analyze the RXTE observations of the 2009 outburst of H~1743-322, as well as the observations of the previous five outbursts for comparison. The hardness-intensity diagram (HID) shows a complete counter-clockwise q-track for the 2009 outburst and, interestingly, the track falls in} between a huge one in 2003, with a complete transition to high/soft state, and that of} the failed outburst in 2008. It leaves the low/hard state but does not reach the leftmost edge of the overall HID. While the lowest hardness (6--19 keV/3--6 keV) values} in the HID is about 0.3--0.4 for the 2009 outburst, similar to the ``failed state transition\" seen in the persistent black hole XRB Cyg X-1, the timing analysis shows that a transition to the high soft state occurred. During the low/hard state of the 2009 outburst, the inner radius of the accretion disk is found to be closer to the central black hole and have an anti-correlation with the disk temperature. These results may be understood as the reprocessing} of the hot corona on the disk's} soft X-rays, which can lead to an underestimation of the inner radius of the accretion disk. In the luminosity diagram of the corona versus the disk, the tracks of the outbursts} in 2003 and 2009 cross the line which represents a roughly equal contribution to the entire emission from the thermal and the non-thermal components;} the track of the 2008 outburst has the turn-over falling} on this line. This may be indicative of an emission balance between the corona and the disk, which prevents the state transition from going further than the low/hard state. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2996  The binary black hole system H~1743-322 underwent a major outburst in 2009, which was observed and studied by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite. The outburst started in February 2009 and exhibited complex temporal and spectral behavior over the following months. We present the results of our analysis of the RXTE observations during this outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find that the outburst displayed a number of interesting features, including significant variability in the X-ray spectra and a flaring behavior which was particularly pronounced in the hard X-ray band. We also observed quasi-periodic oscillations in the power density spectra, with a characteristic frequency of around 0.1 Hz. These observations provide additional support for the idea that black hole systems like H~1743-322 can exhibit very complex X-ray variability during outburst events.\n",
      "\n",
      "We used a number of different spectral models to fit the RXTE data, including thermal disk models and Comptonization models. We found that a thermal plus Comptonization model provided the best fit to the data, indicating the presence of both a soft thermal component and a hard, power-law-like component. We analyze the evolution of the spectral parameters over the course of the outburst and find that the spectral shape and flux changed significantly during the transition from the initial hard phase to the intermediate and soft phases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, our analysis of the RXTE observations of the 2009 outburst of H~1743-322 provides further insights into the complex behavior of black hole binary systems during outburst events. Our results shed light on the physical mechanisms at work in these systems, and may have important implications for our understanding of accretion processes in astrophysics. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2997  Ground state cooling of massive mechanical objects remains a difficult task restricted by the unresolved mechanical sidebands. We propose an optomechanically-induced-transparency cooling scheme to achieve ground state cooling of mechanical motion without the resolved sideband condition in a pure optomechanical system with two mechanical modes coupled to the same optical cavity mode. We show that ground state cooling is achievable for sideband resolution $\\omega_{m}/\\kappa$ as low as 0.003. This provides a new route for quantum manipulation of massive macroscopic devices and high-precision measurements. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2998  We experimentally demonstrate the use of optomechanically-induced-transparency (OMIT) cooling to prepare the quantum ground state of a massive mechanical resonator. We achieve a cooling factor of 11.1 in our system, which is the highest value reported so far for OMIT cooling. Our approach offers a promising pathway towards achieving ground-state cooling of massive oscillators. We also discuss the potential applications of our technique in precision measurements, quantum information processing, and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 2999  We study a 24\\,$\\mu$m selected sample of 330 galaxies observed with the Infrared Spectrograph for the 5\\,mJy Unbiased Spitzer Extragalactic Survey. We estimate accurate total infrared luminosities by combining mid-IR spectroscopy and mid-to-far infrared photometry, and by utilizing new empirical spectral templates from {\\em Spitzer} data. The infrared luminosities of this sample range mostly from 10$^9$L$_\\odot$ to $10^{13.5}$L$_\\odot$, with 83% in the range 10$^{10}$L$_\\odot$$<$L$_{\\rm IR}$$<10^{12}$L$_\\odot$. The redshifts range from 0.008 to 4.27, with a median of 0.144. The equivalent widths of the 6.2\\,$\\mu$m aromatic feature have a bimodal distribution. We use the 6.2\\,$\\mu$m PAH EW to classify our objects as SB-dominated (44%), SB-AGN composite (22%), and AGN-dominated (34%). The high EW objects (SB-dominated) tend to have steeper mid-IR to far-IR spectral slopes and lower L$_{\\rm IR}$ and redshifts. The low EW objects (AGN-dominated) tend to have less steep spectral slopes and higher L$_{\\rm IR}$ and redshifts. This dichotomy leads to a gross correlation between EW and slope, which does not hold within either group. AGN dominated sources tend to have lower log(L$_{\\rm PAH 7.7\\mu m}$/L$_{\\rm PAH 11.3\\mu m}$) ratios than star-forming galaxies, possibly due to preferential destruction of the smaller aromatics by the AGN. The log(L$_{\\rm PAH 7.7\\mu m}$/L$_{\\rm PAH 11.3\\mu m}$) ratios for star-forming galaxies are lower in our sample than the ratios measured from the nuclear spectra of nearby normal galaxies, most probably indicating a difference in the ionization state or grain size distribution between the nuclear regions and the entire galaxy.\n",

      "Finally, we provide a calibration relating the monochromatic 5.8, 8, 14 and 24um continuum or Aromatic Feature luminosity to L$_{\\rm IR}$ for different types of objects. 0 into PostgreSQL...\n",
      "Inserting test sample 3000  This research paper explores the relationship between infrared luminosities and aromatic features in the 24um Flux Limited Sample of 5MUSES. The study is based on the spectral analysis of 144 galaxies observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph. By analyzing the mid-infrared spectra, we were able to determine the luminosity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions and the strength of the aromatic emission features, which are related to star formation and interstellar dust grains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results show a correlation between the aromatic emission features and the infrared luminosities of galaxies. Specifically, we found that galaxies with higher aromatic feature strengths tended to have higher infrared luminosities. This suggests that there is a connection between the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and the heating mechanism that produces the infrared luminosity in galaxies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, we found that the luminosity of PAH emissions is also correlated with the infrared luminosities of galaxies. This indicates that the presence of PAHs is closely linked to the processes that create the infrared luminosity in galaxies. The results also show that the PAH luminosity tends to increase with increasing infrared luminosity, further supporting the correlation between these two factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, our findings provide evidence for the importance of the PAH features and luminosities as indicators of star formation and other processes in galaxies. The results may also be useful in understanding the evolution and properties of galaxies, as well as in refining models of interstellar dust grains and their role in galaxy formation and evolution. Further studies with more detailed observations and larger sample sizes will be important in confirming and extending our results. 1 into PostgreSQL...\n",
